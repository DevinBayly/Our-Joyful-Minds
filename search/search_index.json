The purpose is to show that pleasure from items in the mind that match does indeed pervade our lives. As soon as readers are satisfied on this point they can skip the rest. The phrase \"pleasure from matching\" has already been recurrent. I think \u201clink-joy\u201d is a handy equivalent and shall use it from now on. 1: The Eureka! Phenomenon There are some famous occasions when a historic figure has had a flash of inspiration, but I want to include also you and me. We puzzle for a while and then suddenly we see the answer: Ha! That's how it works! or perhaps That's what will fit! or just plain Got it! On any such occasion, pleasure is a part of what one feels. That pleasure is part of the motivation, too. The period of puzzling is not particularly enjoyable; the reason we attack the puzzle in the first place may be because we expect to get pleasure at the end. Why do we bother with riddles or crossword puzzles? Partly because after solving one, there is a backward feeling of satisfaction, but also partly because we look forward to pleasure at some future moment of success. 2: New Shoes When planning to buy new shoes, one usually has to try a few pairs. Usually the early pairs are unsatisfactory but, with luck, a moment comes when you think, \u201cThat feels just right!\u201d Of course the sensations begin in your foot, but it is in your brain that the sensation of rightness comes up, and it is an upbeat moment, not merely neutral. 3: A Game of Patience The pleasure when a game of Patience begins to come out arises from the fact that one good fit opens the possibility of another good fit, and so on in a cascade. 4: Jigsaw Puzzles This is one of the simplest examples of linkja. You think that the second piece will fit onto the first, you try it and go! Compare this with Twig 33, about socks. After you have found one sock from a pair, finding the second sock is similar to the jigsaw moment, isn't it? \u2014 simple and enjoyable, Got it! 5: The Missing Piece from a Collection Whether it is coins, stamps, autographs of a team of players, or samples of the State Gem from all fifty of the United States \u2014 whatever one is trying to collect, getting many of them is one kind of success, but completing the set may be more important. Where there is a well-defined set of six, for example, getting hold of the first fly a kind of groundwork; nothing in the preliminaries is the same kind of triumphant moment as when you get hold of #6 and complete the set. Ivan Pavlov the dog specialist wrote: \u201cIf we consider collecting, it is impossible not to be struck with the fact that on account of this passion there are accumulated often completely worthless things ... absolutely no value other than the gratification of the propensity to collect. He (the collector) may become a laughing-stock, a butt of ridicule, a criminal, he may suppress his fundamental needs, all for the sake of his collection.\" So wrote the famous psychologist, as quoted by Nicholas Humphrey (and shortened by me, I have left out a few words). And what makes the ridicule etc. worth while? The link-joy! 6: Remembering a Name Suppose you meer someone and are told the person's name. Then three weeks later, while with a friend, you see the same person again. You may remember their name without trouble, or you may have completely forgotten it, or there is a third possibility that many people have experienced: you tell your friend, \u201cThere's \u2014 shoot! I know that person's name, it's \u2014 The name is on the tip of my tongue!\" A common finish to the story is that later the same day, the name bobs into your mind, \u201cWarrington! \u2014 yes, that's the name. I couldn't think of it at the time but that's it.\u201d If you can recall such an occasion, do you remember your feelings? I write feelings in the plural because I think there are several, or a jumbled cluster: there is some relief and surely also some pleasure; the moment is not neutral, it is some kind of upbeat moment. Partly, you get pleasure from the relief, and soon afterward the thought arrives, \u201cWell, I am glad I solved that!\" \u2014 but I want to suggest that a third part is this: just at the moment the name bobs up, you get pleasure because what one part of your mind came up with matched what was tucked in the back of another part. 7: Reading Words A practiced reader uses the \"whole-word\" method. The eye picks up a few clues from the page but the reader's mind comes up with likely complete words (or even whole phrases), finds a good match with the clues and leaps along; reading is a dense rapid stream of micro-matchings. It is also, for most people, a relaxing pleasure; given a moment's leisure, a person actively seeks \u201csomething to read.\u201d I speculate that part of the pleasure comes from the micro-matchings \u2014 obviously not all, but at least some. A REMINDER In case you missed it before, let me repeat that it is not necessary to read all 35 of these paragraphs. Look at whatever is of interest; as soon as you see what I mean by suggesting that link-joy is widespread, the main text awaits. 8: Feeling \u201cAt Home\" A vacation is a treat and home can be boring, but there is an element of comfort in familiar surroundings. When I look around, e. g. at the curtains, I see what I expected to see, what I remember having seen before \u2014 no unpleasant surprises, things are as they should be. As pleasures go, this is small, but yet real. Compare with Twig 11, about eating, and Twig 29, about monotonous ornaments. 9: A Familiar Face There is a real question here; if one sees a face that is familiar but belongs to someone you dislike, does the first moment of recognition produce a tiny spasm of pleasure \u2014 (before being immediately overwhelmed by a flood of more disagreeable feelings)? According to the central idea of this book, such a fleeting spasm should be present, but I know of no evidence that it is; as far as I know, the matter has never been investigated. Of course, when you see the face of someone you like, that is a pleasure but again, there is no evidence that the first moment of recognition contributes to it. The moment when we recognize a face is a moment of emotion and so needs to be considered in these pages, but I am afraid there is too much emotion on such an occasion for us to be able to isolate the effect that I speculate is there. 10: An Expected Musical Note Listeners' encephalograms have been recorded during song-tune experiments. Enough of a tune was played for the listener to know what should come next, but the expected note was slightly delayed and then played. The resulting electric pulse or peak in the listener's brain resembles the peak recorded when a subject is shown for a second time a picture that was already shown a few minutes earlier. In the musical experiment, the two things that match are something encountered and something expected; in the other experiment, the two things that match are something encountered and something remembered. I think that with music, it is fairly definite that when, note after note, one's expectations keep being met, that is part of what makes listening a pleasure. So we have here a small clue to how the matching of two items produces pleasure: some brain-process occurs that gives that particular kind of electric pulse. The straight arrow in the link-joy logo represents a process about which almost nothing is known. The central idea is that some process occurs and is felt as pleasure, but this electric pulse is the nearest we have yet come to tracking it. (The musical experiments were by Dr. Mireille Besson and associates. These experiments and the picture-matching are described in my article \u201cThe brain's internal reward ...\"; for details, see the References.) 11: Tasty Morsels Imagine saying to a blind person, \u201cHere's some chocolate\u201d and putting a piece of steak in her mouth. The person may enjoy the steak, but she would have enjoyed it more if you had said, \u201cHere's some steak.\u201d The extra pleasure comes from the match between what was expected and what was experienced. (A person with normal sight sometimes gets the opposite effect: if you are not attending, you may pick up some tidbit and taste it even though it is not actually what you thought it was; that is, the taste surprises you. The event is in some way unpleasant even if the tidbit is perfectly wholesome food.) Compare these sensations with an expected musical note, Twig 10, and with seeing familiar surroundings, as when one sits at home, Twig 8. 12: Creating Art You have created works of art yourself, either small or large. Would you agree that, before you start, you have some feeling inside yourself that prompts you to begin? (I don't refer to obligations; I mean works that you begin of your own accord.) Your early idea may be quite well formed or rather vague; either way, as the work goes on, don't you get the feeling that it is coming on well, or perhaps conversely that it is not coming out the way you wanted? The point is that there are two things in the air \u2014 the idea in your mind and the thing on the table or easel or wherever it is. Perhaps the work never comes right, it is frustrating and in the end you throw it away; but on better occasions, you gradually get the feeling, \u201cThat's what I wanted; that expresses what I wanted to express.\u201d (It is an old idea: about AD 1270, we find \u201cIn every artist's mind, there already exists the idea of what he will create by his art\u201d (Saint Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologica). The same was probably proposed in Baghdad and in Greece well before that. Here is a neat version: \u201cI dream of painting and then I paint my dream\u201d \u2014Vincent van Gogh.] The point is that your pleasure comes from the match. It is not that the work in itself is beautiful or ugly. You might have intended it to be beautiful and soothing or else ugly and disturbing; whichever way, you get satisfaction if the way it turns out matches what you wanted to express. There is a three-way conjunction: your concept, your product and the resulting pleasure. Twig 16, Creating a Poem, says much the same. Twig 13, about a person looking at or hearing what someone else already created, is a little different. You might think, \u201cThat's all pretty obvious!\u201d The surprising thing is that if you read books about such matters, you find many two-way links mentioned but surprisingly few references to the three-way conjunction in the link-joy logo. If you wish, check out \u201cPrevious Writers' earlier in this Introduction and the anecdote about Willa Cather at the end of Chapter 1. 13: Enjoying Art A cartoon shows a mother at an art gallery with her son gazing at a masterpiece. She bends fondly down to him and says, \u201c Instead of saying 'It sucks' you could say 'It doesn't speak to me.'\u201d The mother is on the right track but neither response quite hits the mark. The artwork may be great and may have a message to convey but the viewer, the young boy, is not receiving it \u2014 he is not receptive to what the artwork offers. Johann Goethe recognized the situation: \"Achievements of which we see the merits, we have the seeds of in ourselves\" \u2014 and we don't see the merits if we don't have any seed already in our experience. For merit to be recognized there has to be a match between the art and the seed; then pleasure ensues. Of course, the art does much more than match the seed, it adds and starts one's mind along tracks it had not traversed before. But the match needs to be there, and it is pleasure from that initial match that makes our attention linger. The situation is particularly clear for a viewer who says, \u201cAt first it left me cold but after a few visits I got more of a feeling from it.\u201d Obviously the work of art does not change, but the viewer gradually finds what it is in themselves that the work relates to. 14: A Beautiful View The fact that there is enjoyment is rather obvious here; why else would people stop for the view so often? But is there matching? One might suppose that this is a simple situation where one stimulus produces one response, as when one steps out of shadow into the sunshine and enjoys the feeling of warmth on one's skin. The other idea is that there is something already in me, before I look at the view, and when I see the view some degree of match is achieved. In favor of this idea, we can note that people differ: the same view affects different people to different extents and in different ways. I think many of the remarks about Twig 13 apply, including the remark by Goethe. What is new here is that we come a little closer to the \u201chigher things\u201d mentioned in Chapter 5. My point is that although admiring a view is, on one hand, much like admiring a painting, on the other hand it is a bit like looking at a clear starry night sky. Now I think of that experience as definitely mysterious \u2014 one is filled with thoughts and feelings of a non-material kind, hard to pin down but with some kind of value; I wish more of us had that kind of feeling more of the time. So what happens when we enjoy a view is a more vague example of the link-joy idea than, for example, a jigsaw puzzle. But it is perhaps an example more worth keeping in mind and pondering. 15: Taking a Photograph A most interesting example of something we do for pleasure! It is a little like creating art, in that there is an artistic result we hope to achieve, and the finished photograph either captures the effect or fails to do so. Then there is a link to enjoying art: there is some overlap berween the pleasures of looking at a photo and looking at an art-work. And there is a link to enjoying the view that prompted the photo in the first place. Some of these effects can be separated: if one's subject is a nasty person, one can still think, \u201cThat's a good photograph!\" And what is good about it? \u2014 some kind of match. 16: Creating a Poem \"Last night these rough passages had astonished him and moved him to tears by certain unexpectedly successful lines.\u201d That is the fictional Yuri Zhivago working on some poems, as described by Boris Pasternak. But since Pasternak was himself a poet, I think it is safe to figure that he too had sometimes been moved to tears. But the tears are brought on by unexpectedly successful lines; they are tears of success or joy at the match between what the poet hoped to express and what he captured. I have not found any record of a painter weeping over his or her work, but in most ways, I think the feelings of joy at success must be rather similar for poets and painters; see Twig 12, Creating Art. 17: Enjoying a Poem Things about a poem that we enjoy are rhyme and rhythm (on Twigs 24 and 28), and metaphors or imagery. Long ago, Andrew Marvell heard behind his shoulder\u201c... Time's winged chariot hurrying near.\u201d Today, if one parks at the side of an expressway, traffic roars up from behind and sweeps by regardless, like the onrush of Time, pausing for nobody. \u201cThe moving finger writes ... nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line\" \u2014Omar Khayyam. As with enjoying art, if Khayyam's imagery links to something in oneself it has an impact; otherwise it leaves one cold. Beside \"rhyme (well understood) and imagery (somewhat understood), there is a third level at which a poem may have an effect, the level of its overall mood or impact. The poem may exhilarate me or cast me into gloom, or it may induce feelings less easy to express in words. Suppose I gather that the poet values some aspects of the sea coast where he lives: I may feel that I value those aspects too. Perhaps neither of us could say explicitly what it is that we value \u2014 the poem is the indirect but best means of indicating that. Even so, if I sense a match between something in the poet's mind and in mine, if I sense that he has t'got it right,\" I feel joy.... Well, things that are inexpressible are hard to discuss. My point is that at the two simpler levels link-joy is definitely a factor, and it may help us to grapple with this third, more elusive level as well. 18: Saying It Well Chris asks, \u201cWhy don't you think a bit more before you start talking?\" Pat replies, \u201cBut how do I know what I think until I hear what I say?\" There is a measure of sense in Pat's reply: after I have said a few words, I judge, Did that come out right, did I say what I wanted to say? And certainly, people sometimes correct themselves, along the lines of \"I did not say that quite right; what I meant to say is ...\" My point is that saying even a few words is like starting a poem or a work of art: one has in oneself at least a partial idea of what the outcome should be like, and the outcome either does or does not match up. And beside occasions when it feels wrong, there are more occasions when one has a sense of things being right. To have phrased a crisp sentence that had its proper effect yields pleasure. Like reading, conversation is a dense stream of micro-matchings There is pleasure also in your friend's response and in your hearing what they have to say; see the next two Twigs. 19: A Receptive Listener Suppose that you have just had a valuable thought and expressed it in a neat remark to your friend. Your friend comes back with, \u201cYou mean the ... ought to have ... (etc.)\u201d If your friend got it right, that is a treat, but if he or she got it wrong, what a nuisance! In fact, people who usually get it right become good friends, and people who usually get it wrong \u2014 it is a waste of time talking to them really; it is clear that they are not on the same wavelength. In short, one seeks a match between what one said or put out and what the other person heard or took in. First, you have to say it well: then they have to \u201cget it\" \u2014 and for a conversation to really swim along, you need to get a response back that makes sense to you. It is these three parts that interweave (like three strands in a braid) and give the two people their treat. 20: \"I Know Just What You Mean\" The three parts of a conversation are: first, you need to make your remark in good form; second, your friend needs to pick up the sense as intended; and third, when your friend responds, you need to see what she means \u2014 and not be puzzled by something you can't relate to. You need to find in yourself some idea that fits what your friend seems to be trying to say. If you are too tired, and keep being tongue-tied, that is no fun. If your friend is inattentive and keeps getting you wrong, that is no fun. And if she seems to be on another track, so that what she says doesn't make sense to you, that is no fun either. It is these three kinds of match-up that keep a conversation sparking along. 21: Enjoying Ball Games One of the great pleasures of sports is to open one's shoulders and give the ball a great whack. Even if one miss-hits, the swing may feel good, but the true joy comes from connecting with the \u201csweet spot.\" Then all the power of the swing gets into the ball, and it flies away to who knows where. Where it heads to, of course, also counts but the satisfaction of connecting well is a treat even if the ball goes wide of the intended mark. The contact you intended is exactly matched by the contact you made. (Compare with a craftsman at work, on Twig 23.) 22: Long Pass in Football For a player, connecting with the \u201csweet spot\" is a unique moment, but what about a spectator? Especially, what about the moment when a long pass is in the air and the receiver is maneuvering in the far field to receive it? For everyone watching, it is a tense moment \u2014 and then tchuk! \u2014 the ball tucks into the receiver's hands and body like a foot into a shoe (Twig 2). Without question, many people are pleased; the point here is to ask, Is this the same pleasure as when the answer to a problem flies into its allotted place, or a musical note comes in exactly on cue? One's brain is in general economical: if a new task needs doing, to do it with equipment that already exists is the common course. Hence one can expect that the brain will use the same pleasure mechanism in all three situations. If it does, surely this all-purpose responder is worth understanding, or at least giving some attention to, in addition to the separate scraps of math or music or football that activate it \u2014 don't you think so? 23: Craftsman-work Whether a master or just a beginner, anyone who practices a craft gets pleasure from it. A person whose business was home-made ice cream avoided automating her work; she said, \u201cIf it's not labor-intensive, what's the point of doing it?\" But as with other parts of our topic, there is a mix of effects to disentangle. Suppose I strike my chisel and dislodge a chip, and what comes oft is pretty close to what I hoped would come off at that blow Different feelings are: \u201cI am pretty clever!\u201d or \u201cThis piece is coming on well, close to finished,\" or \"Just right!\u201d The first two are complicated and are better called thoughts than feelings; but my idea is that the last is simple and immediate. Before any words form, Pop! \u2014 off comes the chip, a good match with what was intended, and the brief spasm of pleasure is sparked, all by a more pre-set quick-fire mechanism than is involved in forming thoughts. There is a parallel with sports and the \u201csweet spot.\u201d After you successfully connect with the ball and fly it away in that gratifying moment, there is the question of where it ends up: in the rough, in the net, in the hands of some skillful fielder \u2014 or perhaps better than any of those, perhaps your stroke was a winner and triumph results. The point is that all that is separate, none of it has anything to do with the the moment of connecting that that thing in one's brain fires off, that fires off at so many other moments in our lives \u2014 that makes conversation a pleasure and by accumulation produces the response, \u201cOh, I had a pretty good day, thanks.\" 24: Rhyme and Alliteration Rhyme yields pleasure; if it did not, it would not be so widely used. Alliteration is similar though not quite so obvious. The present Tree could be called a Tree of Pleasures, but Tree of Treats has a little more of some quality; there is a tiny pleasure from the repetition of syllables. 25: \u201cBaby-talk\u201d As soon as an infant begins to burble, parents begin trying to converse, or at least to engage the infant in a kind of conversational to and-fro. At this stage, there is little emphasis on meaning but there is emphasis on repetition. Even if you are in a different room, you can tell when an adult is talking to an infant from the many repetitive sounds \u2014 mama, boo-boo, etc. Why so? Because the infant enjoys repetition; it continues to be a feature of mother-and-baby talk until meaning gradually creeps in and provides match-ups of another kind. (And what about young lovers? That's another time in life when fond feelings are the central feature and the meaning of one's words is of minor interest. And sure enough, repetitive sounds make a come back: all of a sudden, adults revert to baby-talk and rhyming words.) 26: Unison Fortunately, there are many activities that one can enjoy on one's own, like singing, calisthenics or rowing a boat. But each of these can also be done in company with other people, in fact keeping in time with other people (unison in a broad sense) and is it then more enjoyable? At least sometimes or in some ways, I think Yes. Of course solitude gives freedom and independence, but unison gives something too; there is something agreeable about the fact that the others are doing what you are doing \u2014 your actions and theirs match. 27: Dancing and Marching There are two separate aspects, being synchronous with other people and keeping in rhythm. In singing (previous paragraph), one can enjoy synchrony even in a piece without rhythm, and on one's own one can enjoy rhythm without other people. But when rowing, dancing or marching in company, one keeps in rhythm and in sync \u2014 and there is certainly a tendency, when the session is over, for people to smile, pat each others' backs, and say, \u201cHey, that was good, wasn't it?\u201d Even soldiers coming off parade, though they may not be so demonstrative, feel the difference between a ragged performance and a day when things have gone well. Indeed W. H. McNeill suggests that the Nazis achieved some indoctrination by exploiting this effect. (I refer here to rhythmic community-dancing. Dancing as an art of self-expression is treated along with painting, sculpting etc. on Twig 12.) 28: Running and Rhythm There is a phenomenon known as \u201crunner's high\u201d. It is a strong sense of well-being, a euphoria, that may come upon a runner after a few miles. It is believed to be partly a chemical condition developed in the brain, but also partly a condition brought on by the conspicuously steady rhythmic beat of the feet. And of course it may be both, i. e. a chemical condition brought on by the steady beat, and perhaps by the recurrent pleasure of the beat coming in with an exactly regular repeat. Rhythm contributes also to the charms of music, poetry, dancing and much else \u2014 a universal crowd-pleaser. And regularity in space is just as widespread, in repetitive patterns in rows, as in ornamental railings, or in spreads as in wallpapers and carpets. 29: Orderly Rows In architecture, there is often a row of ornaments along the top of a fa\u00e7ade below the cornice, or along a stretch of cast-iron fencework; other examples are on the hem or belt of a dress; a necklace may be made from a set of similar pieces; and perhaps most memorably, there are the chorus lines made famous by Florenz Ziegfield. The last are a powerful example for present purposes because of the emphasis on regularity. A ragged chorus line is not a treat for anyone; Ziegfield's surprising success was the number of dancers he was able to assemble, all seeming to be exactly the same size and shape. The regularity of these rows is like the regular beat of a runner's feet. And the beat of some simple songs and poems is almost as regular. Someone captured the similarity by saying, \u201cArchitecture is frozen music.\" 30: Wallpaper and Carpets Beside wallpaper and carpets, there are tile patterns, weaving and basketwork. I think the love of order or reperition goes far back in prehistory; I wonder, did weaving or did baskerwork give the first opportunity for someone to create a pattern of repeated motifs? (Possibly the braiding of hair came before either.) Setting that aside, there is no doubt about the abundance of repetitive patterns in our homes and streets; there must be something in the mind that makes them pleasing to the eye. 31: Symmetry of Face \"What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?\u201d I think William Blake is a little out of line there: it is not the symmetry of a tiger's face that is fearful, and in fact a crookedness, some lack of symmetry, would probably make it even more scary. Among humans, the crooked smile goes with the villain, and the lovely heroine is usually closer to symmetrical; her left cheek and right cheek give pleasure because they match. 32: Window Bars Innocent citizens, as well as criminals, spend time gazing out through windows with bars. If there are trees outside and it is winter (no leaves), many branches can be seen passing behind the bars at various angles. If I look out, then by moving my head I can bring a window bar in front of some branch. Perhaps there is a branch or stem going straight up, and then I can bring a vertical window bar to lie exactly parallel with the stem; or perhaps two branches fork, and I can bring a window bar so that it exactly bisects the fork. Do other people play this game? I find myself often playing it, and why so? Because I enjoy the good fits I make. In many of the examples in these pages, a cluster of feelings or processes are all in action at once, and link-joy can be obscured by the others. Thus, if we wonder why the effect has not received more attention, the fact that it is often obscured may be part of the reason. The value of this window-bar example is that it is particularly simple. I play the trick at a moment when I have no particular hopes, anxieties or intentions \u2014 it is just a simple little trick that I play for no reason but fun. 33: Socks when my laundry is dry, I put the shirts on hangers and the socks in the sock drawer. But having found one sock, I like to find its twin. Finding the twin is of course a convenience, enableing me to get on with the job, but is it also a pleasure? For me, I think Yes . For you? \u2014 only you can provide the answer. But what about the underlying point: is i tlikely that a fundamental feature of the human brain, with influence on the marvels of scientific discovery and the magic of soul-stirring music, is it likely that the same feature is at work when we sort socks? A different property of teh brain is that when a new task comes up, it uses and old mechanism if it possibly can. On that basis, I say it is likely ; I think sock-sorting is a clue to a great deal of what is remarkable in the way we think. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein made a relevant remark; \"The aspecs of things that are most important to us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity.\" 34: Spoons and Forks The point here is much the same as with socks, except that whereas socks come in pairs, spoons come in larger groups. Of course one can toss all the spoons and forks into the drawer in a jumble, but many people like to put spoons with spoons, and separately, forks with forks. Partly, that is to save trouble later, but partly I think it gives satisfaction at the time. I propose in Chapter 1 that we all get our pleasure by the same process in the brain, but in some people it is proboked by one source and in some people by another. Are tidy housekeepers also keen on jigsaw puzzles? Are people sensitive to music also meticulous with handcrafts? The answer to the second seems to be No but I am not so sure about the first. Perhaps it is a matter of several effects being mixed together; mostly, when I take an action, it is because of a group of influences combinind and interfering rather than some single influence. Some housekeepers feel to busy to do jigsaws, but there is some overlap, isn't there? \u2014 Some similarity in the feelings that drive the two occupations. 35: Tidying Up Putting away socks and putting away spoons are teated on other Twigs; they are both examples where pleasure comes from putting like items together. But beside matchine, tidying involves one thing fitting another: \"A place for everything and everything in its place.\" A collection of spoons is a bit like a collection of coins: if there is on item missing from a set, to get hold of that item and complete the assembly is a plus. But the same is true for a set of wrenches or of measuring cups, where the itmes are all different. It is even true for the set of parts of, for example, a coffee-maker; putting together items that are designed to go together is a kind of fitting , even if it is not matching. \u2014\u2014 So, if one makes a clockwise traverse around the Tree, this last item on the right links to the early items on the left; fitting and matching are closely allied. It is all one tree, all the twigs spring from one stem, the same link-joy logo belongs on every twig. Beside eating, shopping and sexual activity, these little link-joy stars are an abundant feature in every life. Figure 2 Link Joy logo At this point, different readers will have different questions: \"Does this matter to ME? I am not a psychologist or a philosopher. If I read on, will it make a difference to what I do tomorrow or next week? Answer: Yes, see Chapter 1. \u201cHow does this compare with mainstream neuroscience? People like Damasio, Calvin, Pinker and Konner are university professors of great repute who have tried to explain the human mind to non-specialists. Does this book agree or disagree with them?\" Answer: It largely agrees, but emphasizes a process in the mind that these writers have neglected, viz. the sparking of pleasure from things that match; see Chapter 2. \u201cIs the effect really as unified as you claim? I enjoy watching sports and I agree that \u201chat\u201d rhymes with \u201ccat\u201d.

The point is that there are two things in the air \u2014 the idea in your mind and the thing on the table or easel or wherever it is. Perhaps the work never comes right, it is frustrating and in the end you throw it away; but on better occasions, you gradually get the feeling, \u201cThat's what I wanted; that expresses what I wanted to express.\u201d (It is an old idea: about AD 1270, we find \u201cIn every artist's mind, there already exists the idea of what he will create by his art\u201d (Saint Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologica).

The artwork may be great and may have a message to convey but the viewer, the young boy, is not receiving it \u2014 he is not receptive to what the artwork offers. Johann Goethe recognized the situation: \"Achievements of which we see the merits, we have the seeds of in ourselves\" \u2014 and we don't see the merits if we don't have any seed already in our experience. For merit to be recognized there has to be a match between the art and the seed; then pleasure ensues. Of course, the art does much more than match the seed, it adds and starts one's mind along tracks it had not traversed before. But the match needs to be there, and it is pleasure from that initial match that makes our attention linger. The situation is particularly clear for a viewer who says, \u201cAt first it left me cold but after a few visits I got more of a feeling from it.\u201d Obviously the work of art does not change, but the viewer gradually finds what it is in themselves that the work relates to.","title":"13: Enjoying Art"},{"location":"35_Instances_---_the_Tree_of_Treats/#14-a-beautiful-view","text":"The fact that there is enjoyment is rather obvious here; why else would people stop for the view so often?

The other idea is that there is something already in me, before I look at the view, and when I see the view some degree of match is achieved. In favor of this idea, we can note that people differ: the same view affects different people to different extents and in different ways. I think many of the remarks about Twig 13 apply, including the remark by Goethe. What is new here is that we come a little closer to the \u201chigher things\u201d mentioned in Chapter 5. My point is that although admiring a view is, on one hand, much like admiring a painting, on the other hand it is a bit like looking at a clear starry night sky.

Perhaps there is a branch or stem going straight up, and then I can bring a vertical window bar to lie exactly parallel with the stem; or perhaps two branches fork, and I can bring a window bar so that it exactly bisects the fork. Do other people play this game? I find myself often playing it, and why so? Because I enjoy the good fits I make. In many of the examples in these pages, a cluster of feelings or processes are all in action at once, and link-joy can be obscured by the others. Thus, if we wonder why the effect has not received more attention, the fact that it is often obscured may be part of the reason. The value of this window-bar example is that it is particularly simple. I play the trick at a moment when I have no particular hopes, anxieties or intentions \u2014 it is just a simple little trick that I play for no reason but fun.","title":"32: Window Bars"},{"location":"35_Instances_---_the_Tree_of_Treats/#33-socks","text":"when my laundry is dry, I put the shirts on hangers and the socks in the sock drawer. But having found one sock, I like to find its twin. Finding the twin is of course a convenience, enableing me to get on with the job, but is it also a pleasure? For me, I think Yes . For you? \u2014 only you can provide the answer. But what about the underlying point: is i tlikely that a fundamental feature of the human brain, with influence on the marvels of scientific discovery and the magic of soul-stirring music, is it likely that the same feature is at work when we sort socks? A different property of teh brain is that when a new task comes up, it uses and old mechanism if it possibly can. On that basis, I say it is likely ; I think sock-sorting is a clue to a great deal of what is remarkable in the way we think. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein made a relevant remark; \"The aspecs of things that are most important to us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity.\"","title":"33: Socks"},{"location":"35_Instances_---_the_Tree_of_Treats/#34-spoons-and-forks","text":"The point here is much the same as with socks, except that whereas socks come in pairs, spoons come in larger groups. Of course one can toss all the spoons and forks into the drawer in a jumble, but many people like to put spoons with spoons, and separately, forks with forks. Partly, that is to save trouble later, but partly I think it gives satisfaction at the time. I propose in Chapter 1 that we all get our pleasure by the same process in the brain, but in some people it is proboked by one source and in some people by another. Are tidy housekeepers also keen on jigsaw puzzles? Are people sensitive to music also meticulous with handcrafts? The answer to the second seems to be No but I am not so sure about the first. Perhaps it is a matter of several effects being mixed together; mostly, when I take an action, it is because of a group of influences combinind and interfering rather than some single influence. Some housekeepers feel to busy to do jigsaws, but there is some overlap, isn't there? \u2014 Some similarity in the feelings that drive the two occupations.","title":"34: Spoons and Forks"},{"location":"35_Instances_---_the_Tree_of_Treats/#35-tidying-up","text":"Putting away socks and putting away spoons are teated on other Twigs; they are both examples where pleasure comes from putting like items together. But beside matchine, tidying involves one thing fitting another: \"A place for everything and everything in its place.\" A collection of spoons is a bit like a collection of coins: if there is on item missing from a set, to get hold of that item and complete the assembly is a plus. But the same is true for a set of wrenches or of measuring cups, where the itmes are all different. It is even true for the set of parts of, for example, a coffee-maker; putting together items that are designed to go together is a kind of fitting , even if it is not matching. \u2014\u2014 So, if one makes a clockwise traverse around the Tree, this last item on the right links to the early items on the left; fitting and matching are closely allied. It is all one tree, all the twigs spring from one stem, the same link-joy logo belongs on every twig. Beside eating, shopping and sexual activity, these little link-joy stars are an abundant feature in every life. Figure 2 Link Joy logo At this point, different readers will have different questions: \"Does this matter to ME? I am not a psychologist or a philosopher. If I read on, will it make a difference to what I do tomorrow or next week? Answer: Yes, see Chapter 1. \u201cHow does this compare with mainstream neuroscience? People like Damasio, Calvin, Pinker and Konner are university professors of great repute who have tried to explain the human mind to non-specialists. Does this book agree or disagree with them?\" Answer: It largely agrees, but emphasizes a process in the mind that these writers have neglected, viz. the sparking of pleasure from things that match; see Chapter 2. \u201cIs the effect really as unified as you claim? I enjoy watching sports and I agree that \u201chat\u201d rhymes with \u201ccat\u201d. Now you say that there is some one thing in my brain that underlies both of those kinds of enjoyment and many others too. How could that be, how do you think that could work?\u201d Answer: I make a suggestion in Chapter 3. But the suggestion is mainly to draw attention to the question, to prompt others to come in with ideas. The \"right answer\" could help with various disabilities as well as with managing what we call normal lives.","title":"35: Tidying Up"},{"location":"About_the_Author/","text":"About the Author When Brian Bayly was fifteen a teacher told him, \u201cYou have ideas that are different from other people's.

She is quite long-legged and fond of tennis, and had just come off the court. \"A triple, Brian, a genuine triple!\" I knew what she meant because we had discussed it before: a winning stroke has three totally separate parts. There's the moment of impact, she had caught the ball exactly on her racket's sweet spot; then following its flight, she saw the ball bounce precisely where she had intended, a few inches from both sideline and baseline; and thirdly, of course she had won the point, which gave her the set. It is no wonder that her eyes were bright: any one of those experiences is a treat, and to combine all three in one stroke is what makes a person come back for more. Now here's a real puzzle, the hold that reading has on a person's mind. Life has sunshine and shadows, and even Yasmin is not always full of smiles. I'll tell you about a time when she was waiting for a bus in the rain, because the story is reading-related. It was a really dull night, dark and windy. She was alone at the bus-stop, umbrella up, cold and bored, when her eye lit on a scrap of newspaper. The sheet was lying sodden on the sidewalk; the street lights were dim but she was able to trace some of the text, about headache relief. Now, the town had just bought some new buses and the first she knew was the roar of the bus as it left the stop where she was waiting. The new motor was so quiet as it glided to a standstill, it was not until the driver gunned it to go away that Yasmin realized that it was there.

She is quite long-legged and fond of tennis, and had just come off the court. \"A triple, Brian, a genuine triple!\" I knew what she meant because we had discussed it before: a winning stroke has three totally separate parts. There's the moment of impact, she had caught the ball exactly on her racket's sweet spot; then following its flight, she saw the ball bounce precisely where she had intended, a few inches from both sideline and baseline; and thirdly, of course she had won the point, which gave her the set. It is no wonder that her eyes were bright: any one of those experiences is a treat, and to combine all three in one stroke is what makes a person come back for more. Now here's a real puzzle, the hold that reading has on a person's mind. Life has sunshine and shadows, and even Yasmin is not always full of smiles. I'll tell you about a time when she was waiting for a bus in the rain, because the story is reading-related. It was a really dull night, dark and windy. She was alone at the bus-stop, umbrella up, cold and bored, when her eye lit on a scrap of newspaper. The sheet was lying sodden on the sidewalk; the street lights were dim but she was able to trace some of the text, about headache relief. Now, the town had just bought some new buses and the first she knew was the roar of the bus as it left the stop where she was waiting.

Link-joy isn't everything! Not everyone is the same! Other people are people too! A note on religion Novelty Hopes and intentions Quality time Postscript on choice of words In the middle of a holiday morning, Marza and Anju were having a coffee break. Anju said, \u201cHey, this coffee is good! It is far nicer than the coffee I made at breakfast. It is strange, isn't it, how much it varies from one time to another?\u201d \u201cWell, it is not all that strange,\u201d says Marza. \"At breakfast you let it sit on the stove boiling for a couple of minutes before you took it off.\u201d These two had not been married long and were still learning from each other. It is good to learn, because understanding what brings pleasure or spoils it --- well, the more you understand, the better your coffee tastes. A fairly famous scientist records that one noontime he was crossing the street whistling cheerfully and he wondered, \u201cWhy am I feeling so good?\u201d The meeting he had just left was a workaday affair --- he wasn't pleased by it nor particularly pleased to have escaped it. Eventually he realized that he was feeling good because before the meeting he had solved a problem --- he had had an insight into how the thing could work. Usually the pleasure comes immediately, but on this occasion he had been interrupted. The joy had not come to the surface, it had lain dormant for a couple of hours and then at his free moment it surfaced and filled his mood. (In fact, he got two treats because at noon he was for a moment puzzled by his mood and then thought, \u201cHa, that's the answer!\") The point here is that getting some pleasure is fine, but you are more likely to get it again if you understand the source. Even more simply, suppose you hear and enjoy a song. If it is the style of song that you enjoy, you should look for more from the same writer, whereas if it was the singer's voice that made it special you should look for more from the same singer. (Let's not get too analytical here. While the person is singing, the thing is to enjoy the song, let it pour over you, sweep you along. But afterward, as with Anju's coffee, taking a moment to think what made it so good leads to happy choices in the future.) One can move on to the humdrum daily round: \u201cDid you have a good day?\" \u201cYes, dear --- how was your day?\u201d What makes a good day? What makes a good career or occupation? A higher salary does not mean necessarily a better job, everyone knows that. Everyone knows that some situations or some activities are more satisfying.\u201d I am not in the counseling business, I could not tell any one how to improve their lives. I simply want to point to the question, \u201cWhere does satisfaction come from?\" Well, more than a little comes from that poorly recognized source, link-joy, and to understand that source helps one to manage it. Link-joy isn't everything! Of course not: eating, shopping, sports and sexual concerns are all good too. \u201cI love to stay home with the missus and write, And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.\" And for some people, competing and getting the better of a second person is a real treat. I am not diminishing any of those, I am just adding something else that brings pleasure as well. Not everyone is the same! In an earlier time, the philosopher Bertrand Russell and Lord Russell of Liverpool felt obliged to write a joint letter to a once-unique newspaper, the Times of London, saying: \u201cWe wish to draw readers' attention to the fact that neither of us is the other.\" Everyone is different and most people enjoy the difference. In these days of mood-altering drugs, many people decline on the grounds that \u201cI don't want a new personality; I don't want to lose what makes me ME!\u201d The idea I am pushing is that link-joy is everywhere, everyone is swimming in it all the time, but what brings it on more strongly is different from person to person. For sure, some people are musical, some artistic, some love sports and some love to talk, but all are enjoying link-joy. A musical person gets a specially strong jolt from a match of a musical kind; for a sports-lover the big moments, when a thing comes off just right, are a stroke or a play; for the argumentative, it is finding words that match the inner feelings: \u201cI told him exactly what I thought of him!\u201d Getting it half-right is nowhere near as much fun. Other people are people too! Noting the differences between people moves me on to a large concern. The topic here is pleasure and the emphasis has so far been on getting it for oneself. What has happened to altruism? Aren't we at all interested in bringing benefits to anyone but ourselves? The answer is that we absolutely are. Again, people differ: some are selfish and some are less so; even a single person fluctuates, with moments for self and moments of magnificent sacrifice. But to be altruistic one needs to understand; it is no kindness to give someone an expensive present when what they need is a sympathetic ear, and a forceful missionary, though well intentioned, may do more harm than good through not understanding. True altruism hinges on true insight; you have to try to see clearly into someone else's mind. Well, that is a challenge! No-one fully understands his or her own mind, let alone someone else's. But the more I notice link-joy in my own mind --- like the pitter-patter of raindrops falling --- the closer I come to the ability to get a partial idea of what really matters to a friend. Anyone can tell when Pat is whooping with delight on an amusement-park ride, but when Chris turns from being fretful to being quier you can guess that something has gone right, some kind of link-joy has come off. And if you know Chris well enough to know where his or her link-joys come from, you may not be too clumsy or heavy-footed next time you try to do a good turn. A whole special kind of altruism is our feeling for the young. The most intense kind is that of a parent for their child, but then there are young people such as nieces or the daughter of a neighbor. Even children one does not know get kind attention --- for example, a child who seems to be lost in a large store. The impulse to help such a child is widespread and fortunately many people have the right manner to pull it off. I love to see the kindness with which some adult puts the child back on track. (Myself, I am rather shy and would attempt the task only if desperate, if there were no-one else around.) Then, people heroically save children out of rivers and, for another heartwarming instance, see the efforts a child of age 8 may make to take care of a child of age 5. The point is that here, perhaps more than elsewhere, one needs to give link-joy some room. For sure, every child should learn to swim; whatever a child's inclinations, that is a thing to be pushed. But equally, every child should be set to painting and that can be done with a more tolerant touch. \u201cAre you getting the effect you wanted?\u201d is a central question, and if the answer is Yes, that's good regardless of the technique being used or the sensibilities of the observer. Like adults, children are different from each other and get their link-joys in different ways. (Of course, before an activity can give you link-joy you have to try it. Every child should try charcoal drawing, every child should try the piano --- and ice-skating and learning another language. But not because it is inherently good to master all these skills; the objective is to have each child find out what group of skills they in particular enjoy.) Let me dodge off here to a special sector of children's activities, collecting --- and of course this is not limited to children; in some cases, the older the collector the more avid. P. G. Wodehouse created a character, Preston Peters, who was seized by \"that love passing the love of women that only collectors know.\u201d As Wodehouse asserts, \u201cIt does not matter what a man collects, if nature has given him the collector's mind, he will become a fanatic ... whatever collection he sets out to make.\u201d Pavlov's comments on similar lines are quoted at Twig 5 in the 35 Instances in the Introduction. As to young people's collections --- baseball cards or whatever --- to an adult they may seem unimportant. But altruism involves seeing what is valuable to another person in their eyes, and finding the sixth item in a set of six may be an intense desire, no matter how trivial the items in themselves. For much of my life, experts in particle physics have been searching for a tidy set of fundamental particles; an untidy set is universally detested and exceptional minds have been bent on finding something tidy. This is the same desire as is felt by a schoolchild who so far has five of the desired set of six. It is a trait fully deserving of respect in the young as well as being a strong motivator in the more sophisticated. And however much I may be devoted to other people, however far I place their welfare above my own, however much it is in them that I want link-joy to be felt, the only place where I can learn about that joy is in my own mind. A person who wants to help others has to understand others, and studying \"pleasure for me\u201d is a step toward that understanding. A Note on Religion The purpose of the present chapter is to suggest that link-joy does matter. It is a simple effect that pervades our lives and motivates much of our activity. Along with eating, shopping, sexual concerns and the quest for novelty, link-joy too is worth trying to understand. But wait a moment: something is worth doing? --- something else is not worth doing? What standard are we using here? I hope to be brief and simple but feel the need at this point to recognize religion. In some faiths, all e concerns in mortal life are minor compared with life after death. Also in some faiths there is at least one supreme being, and the \"worth\u201d of any action we might take depends on how it stands with respect to him, her or them. I want to be totally open and non-dogmatic. For some readers, anything in this book is insignificant compared with some eternal truths --- as insignificant as shopping and all the rest. But for some readers, religious beliefs are empty shells; they are the insignificant part compared with today's practical human fears and desires. It is f not to admit this vast range and the different views people have of the significance of daily affairs. But daily affairs are my topic. Readers make take what position they like regarding eternal truths. Within the position they take, daily affairs have some role, be it large or small; and it is in comparison with other daily affairs that I put forward link-joy as something to consider. Novelty When comparing link-joy with other daily affairs, someone is bound to chime in: \u201cNo, surely novelty is what people enjoy.\u201d B: Well, you can enjoy both. Enjoying chocolate doesn't mean you can't enjoy cheese. Does this matter to ME? A: But surely we enjoy novelty because we don't like the same old ... . The same old ... is boring! B: Sure, you can have too much familiarity. Again it's like choc or cheese: given too much, eventually you get sick of it. But people enjoy the first taste. I agree that boredom is a pain and novelty is a treat, but as well there is an undercurrent. It is also true that we are constantly getting pleasure from what's familiar. This matter of novelty is epitomized in Khayyam's rhyme-sequence AABA. \u201cMyself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and saint, and heard great argument About it and about: but evermore Came out by the same door where in I went.\" After the first two lines, the third is a welcome change, but two more things are true: the fourth is a treat too --- we enjoy returning to what we had before. And most important, all of that comes on top of the basic fact that we enjoy the opening two-line rhyme. It is not just that the rhyme or repetition sets us up to enjoy the third line. It is also true that the rhyme in itself is a pleasure. Now let's briefly dodge off down a side-track. What about these other lines: \"A book of verses underneath the bough, A jug of wine, a loaf of bread --- and thou, Beside me singing in the wilderness ...\" It is just a surmise that for some readers this second verse will bring a pleasure that the first did not, \u201cHey, I know that!\u201d Some readers will be familiar with both and some with neither, but for some the second verse is a treat --- the simple treat of recognition. Any recognition is a treat, it is an event in the brain, what John McCrone calls a \u201cphysiological click\" (end of side-track). I will hit the topic of novelty once again to wrap it up. Suppose I am in a garden or a florist's shop and inhale the smell of a rose. What I notice is the agreeable smell; what I don't notice is the flow of air to my lungs that keeps me alive. Novelty is a pleasure we notice, but we get a stream of pleasure from familiarity all the time without noticing it. Like the air, if we did not get it we would soon cease to live. At least we would cease to live our regular thinking gossiping lives. Hopes and Intentions I am still trying to assess: what is important to people? and is link-joy indeed important on a par with other things? Eating, shopping, sex related activities and sports are all big; people vary in their enthusiasms and concern for others; and for some people religion provides the ultimate standard. Then cutting across these strands, novelty is a treat --- but what else? Well, the section heading is a give-away: joy comes from a hope being fulfilled! joy comes when an intention is achieved! Without question, some of these are big; a person may spend years, may spend most of a lifetime on one hope or one intention. So shouldn't we forget about link-joy in comparison with these? Well, first, there is the rainstorm analogy: if a moment of link-joy is like a raindrop, enough of them can sweep you off your feet like a deluge. But the point I want to make here is that fulfilling a hope is a match-up, achieving an intention is a match. \u201cI've been appointed to just the job I was hoping for\u201d or \u201cFor months I've been trying to get that changed and today they finally changed it.\u201d A hope or an intention is in the mind and the external event matches it, just as much as a memory is in the mind and some event reminds us of it. But there is also the sequential or cumulative aspect: let me say a word about that. One example is Yasmin and her tennis game (Anecdote preceding Chapter 1). Another is James Watson and DNA (Anecdote preceding the 35 Instances). Yasmin connected on the \"sweet spot\"; then she saw the ball bounce where she intended; then people applauded her winning the game, set and match and she advanced to the next round, then reached Wimbledon, appeared on TV etc., etc. One might say that the initial link-joy was trivial in comparison with the chain of consequences --- but the consequences were link-joys too: she had hoped to win the game and the outcome matched her hope; she intended to fly to London and there she was in the aircraft about to touch down at Heathrow ... The James Watson example allows me to add on anticipation. Watson noticed a geometrical match and got momentary joy from that. But in the next few hours he talked with Crick and they convinced each other that they had indeed made a breakthrough, solved the problem. Then an enjoyable period ensued: \u201cWe will get a nice report published\" (their first hope matched). \u201cWe will become famous\u201d (a second hope). \u201cWe will get future grants of research money\u201d (third hope) and so on. The anticipation of these events was agreeable because they could anticipate their hopes being matched. In short, a big success is a big train of link-joys, just as much as a small success is a small train. Think of a drum: striking it once, there is a limit to the bang you can get; it is a drum-roll that enables you to build up an awesome cumulative effect. And so it is with big hopes or intentions fulfilled --- they have many small parts. Before leaving the topic of intentions, there is the matter of mastery. Already, when the matter of novelty was raised I proposed that we enjoy novelty and link-joy as well. It is similar with the fulfilling of an intention: there is something else we feel called mastery and we feel link-joy as well. Feeling one does not mean that we don't feel the other. For examples of mastery, look among the 35 Instances at Twigs 12, 21 and 23, Creating Art, Enjoying Ball Games and Craftsman-work. At least in these three, an element of pride enters. For sure, one thing matches another, but in these three in particular there is also the feeling of satisfaction, \u201cI did it, I am pretty clever.\" When I enjoy the pattern on wallpaper or the symmetry of someone's face the pride effect is wholly absent, but at any time when I have an intention and get the intended result, there is this second pleasure as well as the match. (Looking at several other twigs as well, readers may feel that an element of pride or mastery enters, but it is certainly absent from many of the 35.) The point is, as with novelty, to admit freely that this second element is present and real --- perhaps in some events dominant, leaving link joy as minor or secondary. I don't want to claim any more than that on these occasions, link-joy is a part of one's cluster of feelings. Quality Time At the start of this chapter I envisaged the reader thinking, \u201cLink-joy may be interesting to psychologists or theorists but does it matter TO ME?\" We have looked at this question from several points of view and I have offered several reasons for answering Yes. I think I can draw the threads together, can summarize and unify, through that curious concept \"quality time.\u201d The phrase \"quality time\u201d has gained popularity by its usefulness: in the same moment it manages to be both broad and precise. Looking back on the events of a day, I have no difficulty in separating low-grade spells (doing laundry or driving through some congested city streets) from more high-grade spells (reading a good piece in a magazine or hearing my friend Mo explain how he hopes ... etc.) One can't tell when it is coming: if you meet someone in the laundry room, that may turn out the most interesting half-hour of the day. But one can tell when it has been --- the feeling that some episode was time well spent is perfectly definite. Beside being easily recognized, there is also breadth: one can enjoy quality time alone or with friends, working at a project or just being a spectator at a sport, laughing or being serious etc. The range of situations where quality time can be enjoyed is at least as broad as the range in the Tree and we come to the questions: Are they related? and Is quality time specifically those times during which we get link-joy? I don't plan to press the point but I can certainly see some overlap. For example, a conversation: if I feel that I expressed myself well, and that Mo understood me, and that what Mo said in reply was new, cogent and worth my attention, then the time of that conversation was quality time. And its connection with three kinds of matching is set out on the three twigs in the Introduction Say it well, You got it! and I get you! (Twigs 18-20). Conversely, if things don't match up, then the conversation is barren, it is not quality time. All across the top of the Tree, I think we find the same. In craftsman-work, music, poetry or the visual arts, if I am rewarded by good matching my time is quality time, whereas if things don't come off well, being disappointed or frustrated is not quality time. On the other hand, some matching experiences have no impressive quality. For example, sorting socks or spoons, or tidying the house in general: the pleasure is definite, but so small that the activities continue to rate as mundane. So let me suggest that most quality time involves link-joy but not all link-joy yields quality time. Can one have quality time without link-joy? To some extent in a few circumstances, I think Yes, but that is on a minor scale. I am inclined toward the following view: if in the upcoming weekend you would like to achieve some quality time, to ask, \u201cWhere am I going to get link-joy\u201d is a good way to promote some ideas. Postscript on Choice of Words Is \"link-joy\" a misnomer? I have emphasized the abundance of feelings in the mind that are extremely small. If, as you read this sentence, recognizing the words gives you a dozen or more pleasant experiences, then surely each of them must be too small to be called joy. Well, yes; elsewhere I have used \u201cmini-spasm,\" and \u201cmicro-spasm\u201d might serve too. But the language does not contain words for tiny experiences of a pleasant kind. And beside that, one of my purposes is to propose that the same part of my brain handles all these matching experiences from the intense down to the barely perceptible. To range from great joy to tiny joy preserves this unity. The milder term \"satisfaction\u201d should not be ignored, and certainly after a series of small joys or successes a sense of satisfaction may supervene. Does one feel satisfaction as each piece of a jigsaw goes into place? Certainly satisfaction covers the feeling when the puzzle is complete, and perhaps each piece gives a moment of satisfaction... But without doubt \u201clink-joy\u201d has the advantage of being short, and the term recurs so many times that to be short is a merit. I hope the reader will tolerate the term for that reason and join me in stretching it from the large to the very small. When you recognize a word on this page, to say that you feel joy is almost absurd --- micro-joy or hardly perceptible joy comes closer. But we need a single short word for a range of experiences, so please accept joy in this expanded sense.","title":"Chapter 1 Does this matter to ME?"},{"location":"Chapter_1_Does_this_matter_to_ME%3F/#chapter-1-does-this-matter-to-me","text":"Link-joy isn't everything!

Like adults, children are different from each other and get their link-joys in different ways. (Of course, before an activity can give you link-joy you have to try it. Every child should try charcoal drawing, every child should try the piano --- and ice-skating and learning another language. But not because it is inherently good to master all these skills; the objective is to have each child find out what group of skills they in particular enjoy.) Let me dodge off here to a special sector of children's activities, collecting --- and of course this is not limited to children; in some cases, the older the collector the more avid. P. G. Wodehouse created a character, Preston Peters, who was seized by \"that love passing the love of women that only collectors know.\u201d As Wodehouse asserts, \u201cIt does not matter what a man collects, if nature has given him the collector's mind, he will become a fanatic ... whatever collection he sets out to make.\u201d Pavlov's comments on similar lines are quoted at Twig 5 in the 35 Instances in the Introduction. As to young people's collections --- baseball cards or whatever --- to an adult they may seem unimportant. But altruism involves seeing what is valuable to another person in their eyes, and finding the sixth item in a set of six may be an intense desire, no matter how trivial the items in themselves. For much of my life, experts in particle physics have been searching for a tidy set of fundamental particles; an untidy set is universally detested and exceptional minds have been bent on finding something tidy. This is the same desire as is felt by a schoolchild who so far has five of the desired set of six. It is a trait fully deserving of respect in the young as well as being a strong motivator in the more sophisticated. And however much I may be devoted to other people, however far I place their welfare above my own, however much it is in them that I want link-joy to be felt, the only place where I can learn about that joy is in my own mind. A person who wants to help others has to understand others, and studying \"pleasure for me\u201d is a step toward that understanding.","title":"Other people are people too!"},{"location":"Chapter_1_Does_this_matter_to_ME%3F/#a-note-on-religion","text":"The purpose of the present chapter is to suggest that link-joy does matter. It is a simple effect that pervades our lives and motivates much of our activity. Along with eating, shopping, sexual concerns and the quest for novelty, link-joy too is worth trying to understand. But wait a moment: something is worth doing? --- something else is not worth doing? What standard are we using here? I hope to be brief and simple but feel the need at this point to recognize religion. In some faiths, all e concerns in mortal life are minor compared with life after death. Also in some faiths there is at least one supreme being, and the \"worth\u201d of any action we might take depends on how it stands with respect to him, her or them. I want to be totally open and non-dogmatic. For some readers, anything in this book is insignificant compared with some eternal truths --- as insignificant as shopping and all the rest. But for some readers, religious beliefs are empty shells; they are the insignificant part compared with today's practical human fears and desires. It is f not to admit this vast range and the different views people have of the significance of daily affairs. But daily affairs are my topic. Readers make take what position they like regarding eternal truths. Within the position they take, daily affairs have some role, be it large or small; and it is in comparison with other daily affairs that I put forward link-joy as something to consider.","title":"A Note on Religion"},{"location":"Chapter_1_Does_this_matter_to_ME%3F/#novelty","text":"When comparing link-joy with other daily affairs, someone is bound to chime in: \u201cNo, surely novelty is what people enjoy.\u201d B: Well, you can enjoy both. Enjoying chocolate doesn't mean you can't enjoy cheese. Does this matter to ME? A: But surely we enjoy novelty because we don't like the same old ... . The same old ... is boring! B: Sure, you can have too much familiarity. Again it's like choc or cheese: given too much, eventually you get sick of it. But people enjoy the first taste. I agree that boredom is a pain and novelty is a treat, but as well there is an undercurrent. It is also true that we are constantly getting pleasure from what's familiar. This matter of novelty is epitomized in Khayyam's rhyme-sequence AABA. \u201cMyself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and saint, and heard great argument About it and about: but evermore Came out by the same door where in I went.\" After the first two lines, the third is a welcome change, but two more things are true: the fourth is a treat too --- we enjoy returning to what we had before. And most important, all of that comes on top of the basic fact that we enjoy the opening two-line rhyme. It is not just that the rhyme or repetition sets us up to enjoy the third line. It is also true that the rhyme in itself is a pleasure. Now let's briefly dodge off down a side-track. What about these other lines: \"A book of verses underneath the bough, A jug of wine, a loaf of bread --- and thou, Beside me singing in the wilderness ...\" It is just a surmise that for some readers this second verse will bring a pleasure that the first did not, \u201cHey, I know that!\u201d Some readers will be familiar with both and some with neither, but for some the second verse is a treat --- the simple treat of recognition. Any recognition is a treat, it is an event in the brain, what John McCrone calls a \u201cphysiological click\" (end of side-track). I will hit the topic of novelty once again to wrap it up. Suppose I am in a garden or a florist's shop and inhale the smell of a rose. What I notice is the agreeable smell; what I don't notice is the flow of air to my lungs that keeps me alive. Novelty is a pleasure we notice, but we get a stream of pleasure from familiarity all the time without noticing it. Like the air, if we did not get it we would soon cease to live. At least we would cease to live our regular thinking gossiping lives.","title":"Novelty"},{"location":"Chapter_1_Does_this_matter_to_ME%3F/#hopes-and-intentions","text":"I am still trying to assess: what is important to people? and is link-joy indeed important on a par with other things? Eating, shopping, sex related activities and sports are all big; people vary in their enthusiasms and concern for others; and for some people religion provides the ultimate standard. Then cutting across these strands, novelty is a treat --- but what else? Well, the section heading is a give-away: joy comes from a hope being fulfilled! joy comes when an intention is achieved! Without question, some of these are big; a person may spend years, may spend most of a lifetime on one hope or one intention. So shouldn't we forget about link-joy in comparison with these? Well, first, there is the rainstorm analogy: if a moment of link-joy is like a raindrop, enough of them can sweep you off your feet like a deluge. But the point I want to make here is that fulfilling a hope is a match-up, achieving an intention is a match. \u201cI've been appointed to just the job I was hoping for\u201d or \u201cFor months I've been trying to get that changed and today they finally changed it.\u201d A hope or an intention is in the mind and the external event matches it, just as much as a memory is in the mind and some event reminds us of it. But there is also the sequential or cumulative aspect: let me say a word about that. One example is Yasmin and her tennis game (Anecdote preceding Chapter 1). Another is James Watson and DNA (Anecdote preceding the 35 Instances). Yasmin connected on the \"sweet spot\"; then she saw the ball bounce where she intended; then people applauded her winning the game, set and match and she advanced to the next round, then reached Wimbledon, appeared on TV etc., etc. One might say that the initial link-joy was trivial in comparison with the chain of consequences --- but the consequences were link-joys too: she had hoped to win the game and the outcome matched her hope; she intended to fly to London and there she was in the aircraft about to touch down at Heathrow ... The James Watson example allows me to add on anticipation. Watson noticed a geometrical match and got momentary joy from that. But in the next few hours he talked with Crick and they convinced each other that they had indeed made a breakthrough, solved the problem. Then an enjoyable period ensued: \u201cWe will get a nice report published\" (their first hope matched). \u201cWe will become famous\u201d (a second hope). \u201cWe will get future grants of research money\u201d (third hope) and so on. The anticipation of these events was agreeable because they could anticipate their hopes being matched. In short, a big success is a big train of link-joys, just as much as a small success is a small train. Think of a drum: striking it once, there is a limit to the bang you can get; it is a drum-roll that enables you to build up an awesome cumulative effect. And so it is with big hopes or intentions fulfilled --- they have many small parts. Before leaving the topic of intentions, there is the matter of mastery. Already, when the matter of novelty was raised I proposed that we enjoy novelty and link-joy as well. It is similar with the fulfilling of an intention: there is something else we feel called mastery and we feel link-joy as well. Feeling one does not mean that we don't feel the other. For examples of mastery, look among the 35 Instances at Twigs 12, 21 and 23, Creating Art, Enjoying Ball Games and Craftsman-work. At least in these three, an element of pride enters. For sure, one thing matches another, but in these three in particular there is also the feeling of satisfaction, \u201cI did it, I am pretty clever.\" When I enjoy the pattern on wallpaper or the symmetry of someone's face the pride effect is wholly absent, but at any time when I have an intention and get the intended result, there is this second pleasure as well as the match. (Looking at several other twigs as well, readers may feel that an element of pride or mastery enters, but it is certainly absent from many of the 35.) The point is, as with novelty, to admit freely that this second element is present and real --- perhaps in some events dominant, leaving link joy as minor or secondary. I don't want to claim any more than that on these occasions, link-joy is a part of one's cluster of feelings.","title":"Hopes and Intentions"},{"location":"Chapter_1_Does_this_matter_to_ME%3F/#quality-time","text":"At the start of this chapter I envisaged the reader thinking, \u201cLink-joy may be interesting to psychologists or theorists but does it matter TO ME?\" We have looked at this question from several points of view and I have offered several reasons for answering Yes. I think I can draw the threads together, can summarize and unify, through that curious concept \"quality time.\u201d The phrase \"quality time\u201d has gained popularity by its usefulness: in the same moment it manages to be both broad and precise. Looking back on the events of a day, I have no difficulty in separating low-grade spells (doing laundry or driving through some congested city streets) from more high-grade spells (reading a good piece in a magazine or hearing my friend Mo explain how he hopes ... etc.) One can't tell when it is coming: if you meet someone in the laundry room, that may turn out the most interesting half-hour of the day. But one can tell when it has been --- the feeling that some episode was time well spent is perfectly definite. Beside being easily recognized, there is also breadth: one can enjoy quality time alone or with friends, working at a project or just being a spectator at a sport, laughing or being serious etc. The range of situations where quality time can be enjoyed is at least as broad as the range in the Tree and we come to the questions: Are they related? and Is quality time specifically those times during which we get link-joy? I don't plan to press the point but I can certainly see some overlap. For example, a conversation: if I feel that I expressed myself well, and that Mo understood me, and that what Mo said in reply was new, cogent and worth my attention, then the time of that conversation was quality time. And its connection with three kinds of matching is set out on the three twigs in the Introduction Say it well, You got it! and I get you! (Twigs 18-20). Conversely, if things don't match up, then the conversation is barren, it is not quality time. All across the top of the Tree, I think we find the same. In craftsman-work, music, poetry or the visual arts, if I am rewarded by good matching my time is quality time, whereas if things don't come off well, being disappointed or frustrated is not quality time. On the other hand, some matching experiences have no impressive quality. For example, sorting socks or spoons, or tidying the house in general: the pleasure is definite, but so small that the activities continue to rate as mundane. So let me suggest that most quality time involves link-joy but not all link-joy yields quality time. Can one have quality time without link-joy? To some extent in a few circumstances, I think Yes, but that is on a minor scale. I am inclined toward the following view: if in the upcoming weekend you would like to achieve some quality time, to ask, \u201cWhere am I going to get link-joy\u201d is a good way to promote some ideas.","title":"Quality Time"},{"location":"Chapter_1_Does_this_matter_to_ME%3F/#postscript-on-choice-of-words","text":"Is \"link-joy\" a misnomer? I have emphasized the abundance of feelings in the mind that are extremely small. If, as you read this sentence, recognizing the words gives you a dozen or more pleasant experiences, then surely each of them must be too small to be called joy. Well, yes; elsewhere I have used \u201cmini-spasm,\" and \u201cmicro-spasm\u201d might serve too. But the language does not contain words for tiny experiences of a pleasant kind. And beside that, one of my purposes is to propose that the same part of my brain handles all these matching experiences from the intense down to the barely perceptible. To range from great joy to tiny joy preserves this unity. The milder term \"satisfaction\u201d should not be ignored, and certainly after a series of small joys or successes a sense of satisfaction may supervene. Does one feel satisfaction as each piece of a jigsaw goes into place? Certainly satisfaction covers the feeling when the puzzle is complete, and perhaps each piece gives a moment of satisfaction... But without doubt \u201clink-joy\u201d has the advantage of being short, and the term recurs so many times that to be short is a merit. I hope the reader will tolerate the term for that reason and join me in stretching it from the large to the very small. When you recognize a word on this page, to say that you feel joy is almost absurd --- micro-joy or hardly perceptible joy comes closer. But we need a single short word for a range of experiences, so please accept joy in this expanded sense.","title":"Postscript on Choice of Words"},{"location":"Chapter_2_How_does_this_fit_with_mainstream_cognitive_science%3F/","text":"Chapter 2 How does this fit with mainstream cognitive science? Generalists Inward and outward signals Summary An earlier section, in the Introduction, listed precursors of the idea Tam putting forward, not many in number. By contrast, here I look (amazed) at the vast number of people who have written about brains without mentioning this idea. But I will comment on only two groups: first, well-known generalists; second, Erich Harth, Jeff Hawkins and Joaquin Fuster --- bound together by a common interest in the meeting of inward signals and outward signals in the brain. The topic of consciousness has recently been fashionable and has produced a spate of writing but this is mostly not quite relevant; for reasons, see Chapter 5. Generalists Interested readers have had the pleasure of a steady flow of great books. Although it was not the first, let's start with The Astonishing Hypothesis by Francis Crick, published in 1994. The hypothesis is that the brain is a mechanism worked by chemicals and electrically charged particles that we can understand by looking and thinking; a person can use his brain to inspect his brain. Somewhere here one gets trapped in an endless progression: can one think about thoughts about thoughts...? But certainly one's whole brain can inspect the workings of some parts of the brain; one of my sons studies brains and is sometimes his own test-animal. And Crick's hypothesis is that in principle the job will mostly get done; we will eventually be able to explain much of how we think and feel. Well, most writers agree that that day is still far off, but progress is being made and there are many astute commentators on the state of play. Here are four that catch the eye: How does this fit with mainstream cognitive science! Antonio Damasio * Looking for Spinoza 2003 The Feeling of What Happens 2000 Descartes' Error 1994 William Calvin A Brief History of the Mind 2004 How Brains Think 1996 Conversation with Neil's Brain 1995 Steven Pinker The Blank Slate 2003 How the Mind Works 1999 Melvin Konner The Tangled Wing 2nd ed. 2002 Konner names 185 people in his Acknowledgments (is this a record?) and the other authors are also quite well connected. I recall a rhyme about Benjamin Jowert, an earlier specialist in how human beings work: I live here and my name's Jowett; If it's knowledge then I know it. I am the Master of this college; What I don't know isn't knowledge. Nowadays people's claims to omniscience are more limited but if Konner, Pinker, Calvin and Damasio were ever in the same room, they might claim about the brain's major principles that between them they had the field pretty well covered. (I am looking here at people who write for the general public, not the great expositors in the more technical literature.) The upshot is that nothing in these fine overviews conflicts with what I am emphasizing --- they just don't mention it. For example, enjoying jokes gets mentioned in a few places and enjoying music gets mentioned too, in other places. But the need for a mechanism to generate the pleasure and the possibility that a single mechanism underlies such a wealth of human motivations are not recognized. Perhaps the closest that these books come to the link-joy proposal is with assertions such as \u201cPeople are driven to seek patterns\u201d or \u201cPattern seeking seems to be innate.\u201d Here the word pattern is used because it can be extended beyond its narrow sense into music, rhyme, dancing, mathematics and so on. And to say that people are driven\u201d is meant to suggest something that they do for internal rather than external reasons. Thus these assertions are groping toward the link-joy proposal, but only toward part of it. One might expect more from The Brain and Emotion, a great synthesis by Edmund Rolls. But what has been studied is the effect of emotion on how the brain works, as when an excited person \u201cdoesn't think straight.\u201d Events not covered are those when emotion is the consequence, not the cause, of brain activity --- as with the link-joy I describe here. Every human eye has a blind spot and people who study brains seem to have a blind spot too. The present proposal and these great overviews are perfectly compatible but they lie side by side without touching. Inward and Outward Signals Moving on, the books I refer to by Erich Harth and Jeff Hawkins are, respectively, The Creative Loop and On Intelligence (written with Sandra Blakeslee). Harth's subtitle is broad --- How the brain makes a mind - -- and Hawkins too has an ambitious sweep, but the key idea in both books is the same: our eyes, ears etc. generate signals that travel inward or upward, but the signals meet and interact with signals traveling downward or outward. To catch the process in slow motion, recall an occasion when you saw an object but could not tell at once what it was. For example, once I was sitting at a sidewalk table in a street with trees. An object caught my eye, something quite high among the branches of a tree across the street; was it a bird, a cat, a nest or something more accidental? Sometimes a hat gets stuck in a tree, having been thrown by the owner out of joy or by a prankster out of mischief, and sometimes even more surprising things. But the object I saw was rather small for a cat and rather large for a bird, yet it seemed to be resting rather than hanging --- I got no sense that it was hanging limply as a woolly hat might do. It was a puzzle: I could see pale and dark parts but for some time could not discern a head or tail or any definite feature. Eventually a small motion revealed a tail, and at once the whole puzzle resolved --- it was a small cat; its head was just drooping down in a way that made it hard to see. Now consider: what process is going on during the period of uncertainty? One's brain is looking for a match. The first signals from the eye are ambiguous and start the brain thinking of possibilities. The brain thinks \"Cat?\u201d and sends outward some notions of what cats can look like; it also thinks \"Har?\" and sends out signals about hats. \"Looking more closely\u201d amounts to sending inward more specific information and sending outward more specific possibilities. Eventually inward and outward lock together: one realizes, \u201cIt's a cat; that pale patch is its ear.\u201d A more famous example is summed up in the words almost everyone knows, \u201cIt's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!\u201d In such an instance of uncertainty, as just described, the process is long-drawn out and the pleasure of matching is mixed with pleasure from relief of tension. But in \u201cinstantaneous recognition\" there is the same two-way traffic. One's brain uses past experience of cats and birds just as much as it uses incoming signals from the eye. Usually the process is too quick for us to be conscious of it and no tension builds up, but any act of recognition yields a tiny pleasure. Harth and Hawkins provide all kinds of depth and details --- they just miss mentioning the last bit, the pleasure. It was the writer John McCrone who drew attention to that. Both Harth and Hawkins are fully familiar with computing and software. (The computing strategy \"winner take all\u201d refers to the moment when the situation clarifies, one idea beats the competition, and all other possibilities are totally thrown out. This process can be handily modeled on a computer.) By contrast Joaquin Fuster's specialization is wetware, a real brain. His lifelong study has been the composition and working of the cortex, that soft frontal and outer part that is most distinctive of humans. But beside knowing what the cortex is, Fuster has considered carefully what it does. At least since Socrates, people have been puzzling over that and here are Fuster's conclusions: \u201cPerception is the classing of the world into categories. and The categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act.... \" These meaty assertions are worth unpacking. \u201cPerception is the classing of the world into categories.\u201d When I looked across the street and was puzzled, I did not at first perceive a cat. But once I classed what I could see into the category cat\" 1 perceived it clearly. Fuster might have written, \u201cPerception is the classing of everything in one's field of view into categories --- house, tree, cat etc.\u201d This would have led up to his more dramatic assertion. \u201cThe categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act.\u201d The jump from a confused jumble to a clearly perceived cat depends on my having seen cats before. I possessed the general idea of a cat from prior experience and eventually matched the colored patches with that idea. Other people agree about the matching: \"... our perception of an apple is not just based on the integration of shape and form ... but also on the integration of these features with information stored in memory ...\" ---J. LeDoux. Or \u201c... perception is the top-down interpretation of the world in the light of prior experience\u201d ---E. G. Boring. But it was the onlooker John McCrone who noted the third element, \u201cthe physiological click that follows the matching\u201d and \u201cfloods the brain with pleasurable feelings.\u201d The essential role of categories in language is discussed in Chapter 4. But they lead to more than language: \u201cThe categorization of human knowledge ... is the essence of all cognitive functions\" --- that is Fuster again; only the italics are by me. It is amazing how many people have come so close to McCrone's point (and mine) without hitting it. Is it that scientists are cold and unemotional? Absolutely not. It is not that scientists are unemotional but when doing science they tend to filter emotions out or set them aside. The situation is changing; there is now a journal Cognition and Emotion, and someone else may make my point before this book gets into print. As a last example of how close orthodox neuroscience has already come, here is a line from a report on some recent experiments by Dr. Axel Mecklinger and associates: \u201c... suggesting that either an internal reward or an expectancy-confirmation mechanism accompanied correct ... judgments.\u201d An \"internal reward\u201d means a moment of mental pleasure or joy. If they had written \"... an internal reward arising from an expectancy confirmation mechanism ...\" they would have been on the money. I certainly don't instantly read everything that is written and I have not got 185 associates helping to keep me up to date. Perhaps by now these remarks have been overtaken by events. Summary I have seen nothing in recent neuroscience to conflict with the proposal in this book. Instead, the recent trend is for specialists' discoveries to come closer and closer to supporting the present conjecture. Who knows how soon the conjecture will appear in the orthodox neuroscience or cognitive-science journals, and what reception it will get when it does?","title":"Chapter 2 How does this fit with mainstream cognitive science?"},{"location":"Chapter_2_How_does_this_fit_with_mainstream_cognitive_science%3F/#chapter-2-how-does-this-fit-with-mainstream-cognitive-science","text":"Generalists Inward and outward signals Summary An earlier section, in the Introduction, listed precursors of the idea Tam putting forward, not many in number.

Usually the process is too quick for us to be conscious of it and no tension builds up, but any act of recognition yields a tiny pleasure. Harth and Hawkins provide all kinds of depth and details --- they just miss mentioning the last bit, the pleasure. It was the writer John McCrone who drew attention to that. Both Harth and Hawkins are fully familiar with computing and software. (The computing strategy \"winner take all\u201d refers to the moment when the situation clarifies, one idea beats the competition, and all other possibilities are totally thrown out. This process can be handily modeled on a computer.) By contrast Joaquin Fuster's specialization is wetware, a real brain. His lifelong study has been the composition and working of the cortex, that soft frontal and outer part that is most distinctive of humans. But beside knowing what the cortex is, Fuster has considered carefully what it does. At least since Socrates, people have been puzzling over that and here are Fuster's conclusions: \u201cPerception is the classing of the world into categories. and The categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act.... \" These meaty assertions are worth unpacking. \u201cPerception is the classing of the world into categories.\u201d When I looked across the street and was puzzled, I did not at first perceive a cat. But once I classed what I could see into the category cat\" 1 perceived it clearly. Fuster might have written, \u201cPerception is the classing of everything in one's field of view into categories --- house, tree, cat etc.\u201d This would have led up to his more dramatic assertion. \u201cThe categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act.\u201d The jump from a confused jumble to a clearly perceived cat depends on my having seen cats before. I possessed the general idea of a cat from prior experience and eventually matched the colored patches with that idea. Other people agree about the matching: \"... our perception of an apple is not just based on the integration of shape and form ... but also on the integration of these features with information stored in memory ...\" ---J. LeDoux. Or \u201c... perception is the top-down interpretation of the world in the light of prior experience\u201d ---E. G. Boring. But it was the onlooker John McCrone who noted the third element, \u201cthe physiological click that follows the matching\u201d and \u201cfloods the brain with pleasurable feelings.\u201d The essential role of categories in language is discussed in Chapter 4. But they lead to more than language: \u201cThe categorization of human knowledge ... is the essence of all cognitive functions\" --- that is Fuster again; only the italics are by me. It is amazing how many people have come so close to McCrone's point (and mine) without hitting it. Is it that scientists are cold and unemotional? Absolutely not. It is not that scientists are unemotional but when doing science they tend to filter emotions out or set them aside. The situation is changing; there is now a journal Cognition and Emotion, and someone else may make my point before this book gets into print. As a last example of how close orthodox neuroscience has already come, here is a line from a report on some recent experiments by Dr. Axel Mecklinger and associates: \u201c... suggesting that either an internal reward or an expectancy-confirmation mechanism accompanied correct ... judgments.\u201d An \"internal reward\u201d means a moment of mental pleasure or joy. If they had written \"... an internal reward arising from an expectancy confirmation mechanism ...\" they would have been on the money. I certainly don't instantly read everything that is written and I have not got 185 associates helping to keep me up to date. Perhaps by now these remarks have been overtaken by events.","title":"Inward and Outward Signals"},{"location":"Chapter_2_How_does_this_fit_with_mainstream_cognitive_science%3F/#summary","text":"I have seen nothing in recent neuroscience to conflict with the proposal in this book.

We had better look at a mechanism to throw light on that point. Several mechanisms would be better but they are not easy to find; the possibility described in this chapter is the only one I know. It is merely conjecture, but rests on some firm facts about one's brain. At this point I will mention only those brain-features that are needed for the story --- \u201cExplanations should be made as simple as possible but not more simple than that\" ---A. Einstein. Readers interested in some more research that bears on the subject might look at the third item in the References. Structure of Your Brain First a story from the courtroom. A doctor was acting as expert witness for the defense but the prosecutor was giving him a difficult time: Pr. You stated that on June 30 at 6 p.m. Mr. Jones was definitely dead. Had you checked his pulse? Dr. No, I had not. Pr. Had you established the absence of heart-beat? Dr. No, I had not. Pr. Then tell us, doctor, what makes you so confident that Mr. Jones was dead? Dr. Well, I had his brain in alcohol in a jar on my desk. Pr. Hum! That is not a customary line of evidence. Are we to accept it as incontrovertible proof that Mr. Jones was dead? Dr. Well, I suppose maybe not. Maybe he is now out in California or somewhere practicing as a lawyer. The useful fact there is that a brain will fit into a jar --- a somewhat large jar, between a quart and a half-gallon size, 1.3 or 1.4 liters --- or of course it fits neatly into the top half of a skull. For a representation, find a bowl about the size of your cranium and line the bowl with a wer hand-towel, crumpling the towel to make it all fit in. Then fill the remaining space with soft fruit and things with some texture, such as mushroom stalks and boiled onions and garlic. If you can invert it while keeping it full, you have an adequate model of a brain, with the cortex (hand-towel) on the outside and a collection of sub-cortical units filling the interior (mostly in pairs, one on the left and one on the right). In a real brain there are enough fibers, skins and ligaments to hold all the parts together, and for us the important point is: our thoughts are carried out mostly in the cortex, with much less involvement of the sub-cortical parts; conversely, our feelings and instincts arise in the fruit and vegetables, with only slight involvement of the cortex. The next task is to convey something of the brain's complexity. The cortex alone contains more than 10 billion neurons, and each neuron has hundreds of input fibers and hundreds more output fibers (see Figure 2). The output-fiber tips communicate by touching the input fibers of neighboring neurons (or sometimes neurons quite far off), so there are many routes by which an electrical disturbance can travel through the whole web or network. The many output fibers of one neuron may have junctions onto hundreds of different neighboring neurons. How Does Thinking Work? To the extent that such a web is like New York City or London or Tokyo, a thought is like the morning commute. Every workday morning, roughly the same pattern of activity occurs: thousands of agents travel their separate but coordinated paths, and the pattern repeats 20 times a month --- or, for a thought, a pattern of electrical pulses repeats itself perhaps 40 times a second. A difference is that in the brain many of the pulses are propagated around loops whereas commuting is mostly a one-way progression. But for the present purpose this does not matter; the image we need is of a pattern that is very complicated yet repeats itself almost exactly, time after time. More specifically, let's distinguish the western suburbs from the northern. One thought might be like the commute from New Jersey while a second thought was like the commute from White Plains. The point is that many of the same components --- bus lines, subway stops etc. --- are used by both, but the pattern in time and space of the New Jersey rush-hour swarm remains recognizable and separate fro White Plains rush-hour swarm. An outstanding feature of the human brain is the number of things it can do at one time. It takes care of our heartbeat, sweating and degree of alertness; any time we are awake it takes in sights and sounds; and at the same time, we are harboring thoughts, a f\u00f3w consciously but many more floating in the back of our minds. For example, I am listening while Chris explains something to me but I am also thinking \u201cIt's nearly lunch-time\u201d and \u201cI should phone Pat before I go to lunch\u201d (and perhaps also \u201cWhat's that in my shoe, a speck of gravel?\u201d). All these thoughts and more are buzzing at once but there is the matter of attention; some neuroscientists suggest that we attend to only one thought at a time. If we try to think of two things at once, they claim, the best we can actually do is to alternate, Alipping attention rapidly from one to the other and back again. No-one knows for sure but this is the behavior I want to envision. Now for a moment let me turn to Christmas decorations and specifically to the strings of lights that people hang up --- they will provide an analogy. One might have two separate strings and a switch so that the two strings light up alternately. Even if they were hung from the same tree or windowsill the systems could be independent. Alternatively, one might have two strings that were separate except that both used the same ten bulbs for their middle sections. Now turn on the alternator switch at two flips a second: in the first set-up, one string lights up in the first half-second, then the other lights up, and then back to the first; in chat set-up, each bulb lights up just once a second. But in the second set-up, the ten middle bulbs would light once as part of the first string and then again as part of the second string; they would light up twice as often as all the other bulbs. This is a useful analogy as we now go back to brains. Okay, now suppose that I just saw someone leaving a coffee shop and think, \u201cHey, that was --- what's her name?\" One part of my mind is running the recollection of the face and various ideas connected with the face, a pattern of activity like the New Jersey commute. Then in a second part of my mind I think of the name of a distant acquaintance. But in fact it is the wrong name --- so it is like the White Plains commute, wholly unrelated to the first. When I try to put the name with the face, it takes me, say, 25 milliseconds to give attention to the face and then 25 milliseconds to give attention to the name; then back to the face and re-run the pair of tho I give that up, try a new name and, this time, hit upon the correct one, the result is different. I attend to the face and ideas connected with the face; then I attend to the name and ideas connected with the name, and some of these ideas are the same both times. If I jump from face to name and back to face every 50 milliseconds, these particular ideas come up twice, that is, every 25 milliseconds. At the moment when I hit on the correct name, some parts of my brain start performing at twice the usual frequency (like the ten bulbs that are part of both strings). If something like this occurred in a real human brain, the jump to a higher frequency could activate the pleasure system. The face and the name would be called to mind mostly in the cortex, but the pleasure system is probably down in the sub-cortex close to the better-known fear system. It has been claimed that, for its size, the human brain is the most complicated thing in the universe; certainly, there is room in the cortex for some gizmo that is actuated by a jump in frequency and sends a message down to release a sensation of joy. The virtue of such a mechanism is its wide responsiveness. Two thoughts might be two rhyming words, or a sound and a memory, or any of the 35 instances of matching already listed. It is widely supposed that there are parts of the cortex devoted to putting thoughts or ideas together. These parts collectively are called the \u201cassociation cortex\u201d and they can receive all kinds of input --- from the senses, from memory, or from those parts of the brain where hopes, intentions and other imaginary things are conceived. It is just the association cortex that needs to contain the frequency sensor or sensors; we are not looking here at any system of voluminous extent. The weakness of such a suggestion, on the other hand, is that it is merely a guess or speculation. But I have two remarks to make about that: First, everybody knows that there is some such system. People do enjoy rhymes, jigsaws and all the rest. I personally have gained pleasure so I know my brain has this kind of responder, and you know that you have one too. We just don't know where its parts are situated or how it works. Second, guessing at an answer helps to emphasize the question. I don't want readers to accept the above suggestion --- I want readers to think, \u201cHow else might it work?\u201d I should love to see second and third possibilities, so that the hardworking and ingenious experimentalists could set to work deciding amongst them. (This jump-in-frequency hypothesis is presented slightly more formally in the fourth item in the References.) Summary For now, let's see how far we have come. I have listed 35 aspects of daily life and suggested that they all have one feature, matching, in common. I have suggested that this is more than a curiosity, it is an effect that influences a person's whole life. To understand better where one stands today and where one is headed, including one's relations with other people and how to be more genuinely helpful, one would do well to understand this feature. The suggestions are not outlandish. They have been mentioned inconspicuously by at least three other people (N. Humphrey, J. McCrone and J. Fost) and have almost been enunciated in the big-time neuroscience journals. The suggestions are compatible with as much as is known about physical brains. The mechanism I have just described is grossly oversimplified, just a cartoon, and may be quite wrong but our feelings tell us that some such mechanism must be there; we just have to find it. As far as daily life and the future are concerned, maybe that is all I have to say. The questions, Where did language come from? and why are we so different from other animals? are not practical. All the same, I find them interesting. Besides, they provide an occasion for looking at that fascinating object, a human infant, so let us hurry on into another chapter.","title":"Chapter 3 How might it work inside the brain?"},{"location":"Chapter_3_How_might_it_work_inside_the_brain%3F/#chapter-3-how-might-it-work-inside-the-brain","text":"Structure of your brain How does thinking work?

You hold out a finger and the infant clutches it, or you give its foot a tiny shake. You say \"B..bb..bb..buh!\u201d and the infant makes a similar response. Then one moves on to routines --- clapping hands or counting toes; or if a child sits on one's knee there are ways of moving one's knees that make a routine. The first time round, the child may wonder what is happening but after two or three repeats enjoyment sets in. Indeed, who has not been caught by a child Who won't let you stop? \u201cDo it again, momma!\" --- or whoever the playmate might be. There is much in earlier chapters about repetition yielding pleasure but the focus here on infants brings us to learning to talk. I want to show how large a part link-joy plays. Infants Before Speech First a child learns to babble. Infants learn to make sounds and they explore the variety within their power. But before any meaning attaches, an infant is not apt to string together unrelated syllables. If a child is alone and you hear it babbling to itself, you don't hear \"Ka-roo-ta boo-be-ra-po-sat ...\", you hear \u201cB..bb..bb..buh! B..bb..bb..buh!\" --- you hear repetition. Early words tend the same way --- papa, baby, puppy, din-din etc. But I want to look farther back: what is happening in an infant's mind before it starts using words? A bundle! Compare an infant of eight months with a new-born: what a store of knowledge has been built up! And it has been built up by recurrence. Events that recur get remembered; an event that happens only once has no effect unless it is of a particularly arresting kind. The mother's face and smell, the milk, the pillow and the light from the window become known familiar items in the infant's world. The infant does not think of a series, thinking \u201cThat light I have seen before has come on again\u201d --- it forms the concept of a single window that is continuously there. Shapes, colors and qualities such as softness get to be known. By six months, an infant has seen enough blue objects to know the idea of \u201cblue,\" and then from around six months onward a new tendency develops: given a medley of colored beads, an infant spontaneously tends to pair two of the same color together --- either touching one and then the other or pushing one toward the other. There is a great difference between what a child can be taught to do by training and what they do spontaneously, the former having been far more extensively studied. But the latter spontaneous activities are the topic here. Why does a child pair off beads of a similar color or similar shape? Because the child is free, it is \"doing what it likes.\u201d The child likes to pair off two similar beads; why else would she do it? Now let's extend that idea by guesswork. If you give an infant a ball today, I guess that she likes to remember a ball she saw yesterday and to think of the two balls together. Equally, if you say \u201cball\u201d she likes to remember that you said the same often before and likes to put the sounds together. There is finally a moment when she makes the link and realizes that the sound goes with the object --- but before that moment, the child already has in mind a cluster of objects she habitually thinks of together. If she did not have such a cluster, she could never realize what your word \"ball\u201d refers to --- she would be stuck with the mistaken idea that that was the name of some particular ball. And if she did not enjoy thinking of similar things in clusters, she would never be in that way prepared. As Joaquin Fuster expresses it, \u201cPerception is the classing of the world into categories ...\" and \u201cThe categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act...\u201d. And those matching acts are what an infant is so busy doing before it learns to talk. If only parents did not interfere! The means by which an infant learns language would be easier to study if parents would stay away and stop teaching it. No chance! But readers may be aware of those surprising events that occurred around 1990 among some deaf children in Nicaragua. If a child is born deaf in a small isolated community, its caretakers usually develop sufficient gestures for the child to function from day to day, but the child rarely learns to communicate in a fully human way. But a well-intentioned government in Nicaragua set up a residential school and gathered a number of such children together with the idea of teaching them more effectively. The formal operation was slowly getting into gear when it was noticed that, all on their own, the children were signing to each other. The truly surprising part was that their \u201cspeech\u201d was not limited to simple words and phrases like \u201cGive me that.\u201d The children developed a language with sentence structure, abstract ideas and the beginnings of a grammar --- an adequate basis for a totally expressive flexible language. If only hidden cameras and specialists in language had been there to record the process! As it is, the records are fragmentary but there is no doubt about the result: spontaneous development of words and sentences because the children had things already formed in their minds that they wanted to say. Other writers on the subject of infants have emphasized the social end more than the cognitive or self-expression aspect. For sure, an infant enjoys company; it is the presence of a second person that provides much of the fun. And what motivated the young Nicaraguans was the joy of signing to each other. But before that part can be fun, one has to have something to say. Once one's own mind possesses concepts and begins to see relations among them there is this stage: one thinks, for example, \u201cI saw a tree like that yesterday\" except that one has no inner language to express the thought even to oneself. Without words, one perceives a tree, retrieves a memory, sees a resemblance and feels joy. But it is all inarticulate --- one cannot share one's joy for lack of words. It is proper to emphasize the social end; it is certainly a social desire that makes one eager to share one's thoughts. But to form the thoughts in the first place in oneself, one needs concepts like \"tree,\" \"ball\u201d and yesterday.\u201d And it is the early solitary pleasure of mentally grouping similar objects (during the silent eight months) that prompts the infant to form concepts. Let me summarize by changing Fuster's words slightly: \u201cWhen an infant looks around, its perception of its surroundings is the classing of what it sees into categories (window, pillow, mother etc.) The categorizing that forms the infant's percepts is essentially a matching act between a thing seen now and things already in mind ...\". And what Fuster forgot to mention: it is pleasure from the matching act that makes the infant do it so irrepressibly. Infants in general are fairly happy. When not hungry or hurting, they explore their world, move things around, chase beetles etc. They exercise curiosity and gradually make sense of things. The infant is happy because making sense of things is fun; making sense of things is a matching act and matching sets off link-joy. Most infants do not keep a diary, they do not record these processes and mostly forget them. But here is Helen Keller remembering: \u201cThat living word awakened my soul, gave it light, joy, set it free!\" (The work on spontaneous pairing was led by Jonas Langer. The Nicaraguan children's activity is described in Chapter 2 of The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker.) Chimpanzees Now it is time to write about Roger Fouts. I mentioned already a curious fact: enormous efforts have been made to discover what children can be taught to do by training, compared with very little effort to record systematically what they do if left alone. It is similar with chimpanzees, though here it is more understandable. With chimpanzees and language, if left alone, what they do is Not much. What has been discovered by extraordinarily persistent efforts is what they can be trained to do. Well, the short answer is that if rewarded with, for example, sips of sweet fruit juice --- (over and over ... no, try it again ... and again ... yes! now again ... and once more, come on! ...) --- if sufficient money, patience and hours of time are expended, a young chimpanzee can be taught enough sign language to express simple thoughts. But with increasing age, the learning rate drops off and beside that, the student becomes hard to manage, excessively strong. So the experimenter takes on a new learner and the world acquires another trained old-timer for the chimpanzees' retirement home. To his eternal credit, Roger Fouts took this population seriously. He moved mountains to provide an adequate home where these ex-students could have some approximation to an ordinary chimpanzee life --- except, of course, that they could sign to one another if they wanted to. They were not in any sense on display; their autonomy and privacy were fully upheld. But for a while there was one section of glass wall, and a human who knew sign language could walk up to it and make a remark. Maybe no inmate was looking, or maybe one would look but pay no attention, but occasionally one would sign back and chat briefly with the visitor. But the whole process never went far. The chimpanzees were occasionally seen signing to each other as well as using gestures and grimaces; and sure enough, infants born in the retreat learned a few signs from their elders with no human intervention whatever (no sips of juice). All the conditions were present for spontaneous development of language to occur but hardly anything happened. Recall the Nicaraguan children. No-one was teaching them, yet you could not stop their language from developing. The children enjoyed new words, new forms of sentence, new thoughts to express. Here is Fuster again: \"... categorization ... is the essence of all cognitive functions ...\" --- it provides simple concepts such as \u201cball\u201d and more abstract ones like \u201crestrictive adjectival clause\" but the children formed them all. And why did they? For why, if not for enjoyment? Of course children have larger brains than chimpanzees and may be differently related to a supernatural entity. But as well as these aspects, I think enjoyment might have motivated the children and not the chimpanzees. (Beside language-trained chimpanzees, there are many no longer needed in medical programs or in circuses; there are now several large habitats and some hundreds of chimpanzees in retirement. But as far as I know the community founded by Fouts is the only one where language-trained chimpanzees form the social group.)","title":"Chapter 4 Infants and language"},{"location":"Chapter_4_Infants_and_language/#chapter-4-infants-and-language","text":"Infants before speech Chimpanzees Some time soon, you will see an agreeable sight --- an older child or an adult playing with a baby.

Then one moves on to routines --- clapping hands or counting toes; or if a child sits on one's knee there are ways of moving one's knees that make a routine.

I want to show how large a part link-joy plays.","title":"Chapter 4 Infants and language"},{"location":"Chapter_4_Infants_and_language/#infants-before-speech","text":"First a child learns to babble. Infants learn to make sounds and they explore the variety within their power. But before any meaning attaches, an infant is not apt to string together unrelated syllables. If a child is alone and you hear it babbling to itself, you don't hear \"Ka-roo-ta boo-be-ra-po-sat ...\", you hear \u201cB..bb..bb..buh! B..bb..bb..buh!\" --- you hear repetition. Early words tend the same way --- papa, baby, puppy, din-din etc. But I want to look farther back: what is happening in an infant's mind before it starts using words? A bundle! Compare an infant of eight months with a new-born: what a store of knowledge has been built up! And it has been built up by recurrence. Events that recur get remembered; an event that happens only once has no effect unless it is of a particularly arresting kind. The mother's face and smell, the milk, the pillow and the light from the window become known familiar items in the infant's world. The infant does not think of a series, thinking \u201cThat light I have seen before has come on again\u201d --- it forms the concept of a single window that is continuously there. Shapes, colors and qualities such as softness get to be known. By six months, an infant has seen enough blue objects to know the idea of \u201cblue,\" and then from around six months onward a new tendency develops: given a medley of colored beads, an infant spontaneously tends to pair two of the same color together --- either touching one and then the other or pushing one toward the other. There is a great difference between what a child can be taught to do by training and what they do spontaneously, the former having been far more extensively studied. But the latter spontaneous activities are the topic here. Why does a child pair off beads of a similar color or similar shape? Because the child is free, it is \"doing what it likes.\u201d The child likes to pair off two similar beads; why else would she do it? Now let's extend that idea by guesswork. If you give an infant a ball today, I guess that she likes to remember a ball she saw yesterday and to think of the two balls together. Equally, if you say \u201cball\u201d she likes to remember that you said the same often before and likes to put the sounds together. There is finally a moment when she makes the link and realizes that the sound goes with the object --- but before that moment, the child already has in mind a cluster of objects she habitually thinks of together. If she did not have such a cluster, she could never realize what your word \"ball\u201d refers to --- she would be stuck with the mistaken idea that that was the name of some particular ball. And if she did not enjoy thinking of similar things in clusters, she would never be in that way prepared. As Joaquin Fuster expresses it, \u201cPerception is the classing of the world into categories ...\" and \u201cThe categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act...\u201d. And those matching acts are what an infant is so busy doing before it learns to talk. If only parents did not interfere! The means by which an infant learns language would be easier to study if parents would stay away and stop teaching it. No chance! But readers may be aware of those surprising events that occurred around 1990 among some deaf children in Nicaragua. If a child is born deaf in a small isolated community, its caretakers usually develop sufficient gestures for the child to function from day to day, but the child rarely learns to communicate in a fully human way. But a well-intentioned government in Nicaragua set up a residential school and gathered a number of such children together with the idea of teaching them more effectively. The formal operation was slowly getting into gear when it was noticed that, all on their own, the children were signing to each other. The truly surprising part was that their \u201cspeech\u201d was not limited to simple words and phrases like \u201cGive me that.\u201d The children developed a language with sentence structure, abstract ideas and the beginnings of a grammar --- an adequate basis for a totally expressive flexible language. If only hidden cameras and specialists in language had been there to record the process! As it is, the records are fragmentary but there is no doubt about the result: spontaneous development of words and sentences because the children had things already formed in their minds that they wanted to say. Other writers on the subject of infants have emphasized the social end more than the cognitive or self-expression aspect. For sure, an infant enjoys company; it is the presence of a second person that provides much of the fun. And what motivated the young Nicaraguans was the joy of signing to each other. But before that part can be fun, one has to have something to say.

A link to religion Consciousness Ideals and \u201chigher things\u201d My program here has been to start from what is incontrovertible and move only cautiously to what is more doubtful. People do jigsaw puzzles; People enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles; What they enjoy mostly is the good fit of one piece with the next. People recite rhymes; People enjoy reciting rhymes; What they enjoy mostly is the rhyme of one word with the preceder. Joy from a jigsaw arises in my brain; There's an item in my brain that creates joy from a jigsaw. Joy from a rhyme arises in my brain; There's an item in my brain that creates joy from a rhyme. There is similarity between enjoying a jigsaw and enjoying a rhyme; Perhaps it is the same item that creates joy in both contexts. Perhaps I would manage my life better if I gave a little more attention to this effect; perhaps we would all manage our lives better if we jointly gave attention to this effect. But in this chapter, I abandon caution, strike out into the deep ocean, and offer some mere speculations. Like swimmers in the deep ocean, we lose touch with firm ground and may get swept to places that are not familiar. But at least I can name some topics --- see the chapter contents above. Let me reiterate that I claim no special authority and the whole chapter may have no practical value. The reader perhaps shares my inquisitiveness; if so, let's get on with it. But the uncertainties in this chapter should not obscure what seem like certainties in the chapters before. What Makes Humans so Special? As already mentioned, the answer may be our relation to the supernatural, to a god or God or goddesses. On this point I have a belief or faith but I don't want to expound it, beyond saying that I think the earth is billions of years old and that, whoever is in charge, most attributes of people today evolved from a common ancestor that we share with chimpanzees. But beside the possibility of a divine spark, there are visible differences --- a vast range of differences between present day people and chimpanzees. According to the theory of evolution, if we trace these differences backward in time they eventually taper to nothing. And then if we begin to creep forward again, there is a moment when some difference or differences existed but were tiny; yet despite being tiny, they contained the seeds of all the differences we see now. One wonders about that crucial moment what the tiny difference or differences were. Obviously I don't know the answer. Many people have offered possibilities and each suggestion has some merit. My intention here is to add the suggestion that link-joy may have been a factor, and to suggest that as a factor it could perhaps have been large. First, let's avoid being over-simple. It seems that the human chimpanzee split occurred around 7 million years ago but we should not imagine, from that point on, just two populations or lines of descent, one leading to present-day chimpanzees and the other to humans. On either side there may well have been several branches. Indeed the chimpanzee side split into bonobos (\"pigmy chimpanzees\u201d) and the regular kind, and may have included other varieties as well, now extinct. On the human side, the majority opinion is that all present-day humans are descended from a group that existed in Africa less than 200 million years ago; all other variants that existed at that time on other continents are now extinct. In short, either side of the tree of descent was multi-branched. But the extra branches don't affect the basic question, Could link-joy have made a difference? Or perhaps it would be better to ask, How much difference could link-joy have made? We need to peer into a chimpanzee's mind: how much forward planning do they do? After reading lane Goodall's reports, I think it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that before settling in for the night, a chimpanzee has some ideas about the next day. She may remember the tree from which she got fruit today; she may imagine returning to that same tree again tomorrow (a fairly definite image), but I think she might instead carry in her mind the less specific idea \u201csome other fruit tree.\" She might imagine heading in a fresh direction tomorrow to an area where she thinks \u201csome other fruit tree\u201d is likely to be found. Of course all this thinking is done without words but a chimpanzee that has seen many trees can extract from that experience a general idea \"tree\" and the more specific idea \"fruit tree.\u201d Now she does this by grouping her memories of fruit trees in one group, nut trees in another group, and so on. The manner in which chimpanzees do their foraging indicates this much about their minds. But chimpanzees are pretty much down-to-earth; there is nothing high-falutin' about a chimpanzee. They form abstract concepts like \"some fruit tree\u201d (imagined in vague form, not specific) but only as far as material affairs are concerned. Where people might give much of their time to eating, shopping, sexual affairs and sport, with a chimpanzee you can leave out the shopping and sport. (On the other hand, to give them credit, some devote much time and care to raising their young; some are tender-hearted parents.) My point is that they don't speculate, they don't have flights of fancy, they don't juggle ideas for fun --- and that is exactly what people do. A person's mind is continually spinning ideas; even while we sleep, the ideas fly about and pop up in unusual combinations. But now I am looking at present-day people; what about early people, when they were much closer to chimpanzees? Here is what may have been crucial: once a person gets joy from matching two ideas together, there doesn't have to be any material gain. Once people get joy from matching, they are apt to sit around combining ideas just for the fun. For an example, think of one of our ancestors who sees a cloud above a mountain, a tree-branch above the ground, and her knee above her foot. With link-joy, she may think, \"That's neat, three examples of the same thing!\" --- and remember them, and later add a fourth. Without link-joy, the ancestor would know perfectly well what to do about fruit that was above her, but would never make the cloud-above-mountain connection. [A historical detail: in old-fashioned language, one might say that the ancestor I just described extracted the general character \u201cabove\u201d from the three instances. To \u201cextract a character\u201d would nowadays more often be called extracting a characteristic. But William James in 1892, more than a century ago, wrote \u201c... (animals) never extract characters for the mere fun of the thing, as men do.\" He put his finger on the very same difference that I am emphasizing now. But James did not see it as a possible cause of man's uniqueness, a cause of the divergence from chimpanzees --- probably because he was not looking for such a cause. And people who have looked for a cause since perhaps have not noticed James' perception.] There is a particular difficulty about the origin or development of human language. I distinguish here between language in animals (which covers material concerns --- eating, mating etc. --- and is limited) and language in humans (which by now covers an unimaginable variety and must from early on have had a tendency to sprout copiously). What language sprouts into so abundantly is words, ideas or concepts that are not of immediate material use. For sure, such words become useful later; once conversation gets started, a rich language facilitates all kinds of benefits. But what is the benefit at an earlier stage? To invent language about something of no immediate use, one has to form an idea (\u201chave something to say\u201d), then invent a word, and then find another person who might have formed the same idea and be ready to grasp the meaning of your word when you say it. As is often true today, an invention has to happen first and then its usefulness can be discovered later. So why would an early human form a useless idea and try to mention it to a companion? It is a formidable difficulty. But if forming an idea --- like the idea \"above\" in the example just discussed --- was a pleasure in itself, the difficulty is overcome; the pleasure is the motivation. A Link to Religion Some people believe that all religions are groundless. For such people, a puzzling question is, Where have religions come from? If there are not any supernatural entities, why do so many people believe that there are? Once a religion is well founded, many people believe it because their parents believed it, belief being inculcated while the person is young. But the question remains how a religion gets started in the first place. Partial answers have been offered on the following lines: 1 While a person is young and in the care of its parents, the idea that \"someone will take care of me\" is apt to take root. After the parents die, the idea remains attractive and a person may unconsciously invent a parent-substitute. 2 People from time to time have hallucinations. Some plants cause unusual states of mind, and some people can produce trances by sitting still etc. In some of these states, a person is seized by a conviction such as that everything exists because of a benevolent unifying influence. And such a conviction may persist or be remembered after the person returns to \u201cnormal.\u201d 3 Some natural events seem larger than human. Suppose an infant is chided by someone in a gruff voice and then hears thunder. It would not be surprising it the infant imagined that there is an even larger person with an even gruffer voice. Or suppose that in a community there is some conspicuously splendid, healthy, powerful, vigorous man or woman, and yet that person suddenly dies. The idea of their being struck by someone even more powerful but invisible might appear a possibility. The last of these is plausible cause for fear of a god, but what might prompt belief in a god or gods of benevolent type? Items 1 and 2 are possibilities, but I want to enlarge on item 3: can the natural world make us believe in benevolent gods as well as fearsome ones? I would not raise the question if I had no answer for it. The whole discussion is begun so that I can make a suggestion: a person is apt to be seized occasionally by the idea, \u201cIt's good to be alive!\" One's muscles seem to be working, one recently tasted something good, one has an occupation at which one expects to succeed and there are drifting clouds in a blue sky. Everything is as it should be, to such a marked extent that one thinks, \u201cSomeone must have organized this!\" Now \u201ceverything as it should be\u201d is a matching condition; the state matches an idea within oneself. Years of life provide an internal sense of how things should be and sometimes when one looks around, that's how they are. For example, when one admires an extensive view one's sense is, \u201cThat's as it should be. There is an enormous extent of stuff in view and it is all as it should be.\u201d One's pleasure from the matching is considerable and the idea that a benevolent god set it up comes rather readily to mind. Of course the majority of people believe that a benevolent god or God did set it up. In this section, I am just sketching a possibility in case it is of interest to the minority. Consciousness A fashionable topic! Consciousness is fashionable and link-joy unfashionable. Consciousness is something we share with chimpanzees while link-joy probably is not --- link-joy may be what makes humans unique. Surely what makes us different from chimpanzees is more interesting than what we share with them, yet consciousness is fashionable! There is no accounting for fashion. (Well, perhaps there is, but that is not our business here.) Some readers will already have objected, \" Human consciousness is different, human consciousness is something we do not share with chimpanzees.\u201d A person thinking on these lines may be thinking of self-consciousness, a person's awareness of his or her unique self. It is commonly supposed --- as far as I know correctly --- that a person's thoughts or feelings about his or her self, her personality, uniqueness, place in the universe etc. are more extensive than those of a chimpanzee; perhaps self -consciousness is what we should discuss. Now suppose someone suggests that what makes humans unique is this self-consciousness --- \"we have it, all other animals don't.\" I suggested earlier in this chapter that, instead, perhaps it is link-joy that makes humans unique, so how do these two suggestions fit together or clash? My thought is that self-awareness depends on link-joy. Self-awareness is just one among a group of things that only humans possess, but the whole group depends on link-joy and link-joy is the basic difference. The reason has to do with abstract concepts and levels of abstraction. I already looked at a chinipanzee's limited range of material concerns, and suggested that lini-ay will make a primate cogitate further. Simply for fun, to gain link-joy, a primate might for example gather instances of \"above.\" And, watching a river, she might conceive \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201crough\"; hearing a cushing river and the wind, she might \u201cnoisy.\u201d I am looking for concepts that don't help directly with finding food or avoiding harm, but might seem interesting. A primate who watches a smooth patch on a river might indicare it to a companion and (probably after a few false starts), they might agree on a sound to associate with it. Thus would begin the joy of conversation, and soon the material benefits of conversation and improved cooperation would reinforce the developments. But aside from material benefits, one level of abstraction leads to another: after \u201cnoisy\u201d and \u201cquiet\" comes the idea of loudness --- a thing that can be great or small. The difference between \u201csimple\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d is somewhat abstract, and a primate's ideas about time can obviously get more sophisticated by degrees. Finally, as part of this general process of building up more abstract ideas about the world, the primate builds more sophisticated ideas about herself; self-awareness develops along with growth-of-trees awareness, meteorology-awareness and ecological-balance awareness. Their own selves is just part of the package of things that humans understand and other animals do not, but the entire package depends on link-joy --- that's my suggestion. Ideals and \u201cHigher Things\" If you were in the Louvre and saw someone approaching the Mona Lisa with a meat axe, would you hurl yourself in her way, even at great risk to yourself? If indeed the worst happened and you lay on the floor progressing toward death, but the felon was caught and the picture saved, would you think, \u201cI am glad. That picture is worth the sacrifice I have made\u201d? I hope no reader is faced with this situation. I imagine it just as an example of what I mean by \u201chigher things.\u201d The value of a great work of art is elusive --- many people feel that its value is in some way great, but in what way and how great are not so easy. An example closer to home involves truth and friendship. Should one lie to save a friend or allow harm to a friend for the sake of upholding truth? How much value does truth or friendship have? I am not going to try to answer these questions. My aim is simply to bring this kind of question into view. I want to establish the fact that there are values that everyone finds hard to pin down. One may be devoutly religious or quite the opposite; for all kinds of person, truth is apt to conflict with friendship from time to time. I emphasize the uncertainty just so that I can go a step farther: can attention to link-joy shed light on this difficult zone? Obviously I think link-joy can help --- I would not be writing this paragraph else. I don't think it can help much, but perhaps a little, enough for the line of thought to be worth pursuing. And the line of thought is: let us progress from the simple toward the more complex, from what's definite toward what is more nebulous. Here is an oversimplified picture: both poetry and music can be enjoyed at three levels. In poetry the simplest pleasures are those of rhyme and meter: Fear no more the heat o' the sun, Nor the furious winter's rages; Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta\u2019en thy wages. \u201cWages\" matches \u201crages,\" \"done\u201d matches \u201csun\u201d --- and tum ti-tum, ti-tum, ti-tum, the last four beats give us pleasure by matching the four before. Then a second level is that of metaphor, simile, allusion and so on. Does winter get in a furious rage? Certainly, on some blizzard nights I have felt that winter was actively malevolent, attacking me in person; I enjoy the match with the poet's thought there. But there is a third level, concerned with fortitude, acceptance and hope: if I enjoy the poem at this third level, is it because of some match with what I already feel, or do I enjoy Shakespeare's showing me a new possibility, as if opening a door? When I enjoy the poem as a whole, it is not so easy to say exactly what it is that I enjoy. With music similarly, the simplest pleasure is the rhythm. Then at the second level there are melodies, themes, variations and so on. We expect, we recognize, we enjoy various matchings among the sections of a song or an instrumental piece, and at this level I might hope to explain to someone else what it is that I enjoy. But again there is a third level, the impact of the song or sonata as a whole, that is much more difficult to express in words: what did the composer intend, what was the effect on my mood, does it matter if these two diverge, for what purpose does one listen and the other compose? Well, that picture is certainly oversimplified. In particular, the idea of three distinct and separable levels is hard to maintain. But the idea of a progression from simple toward complex and from definite toward indefinite seems robust. And the progression is gradual; I think it would be just as hard to maintain that there is a break, with two distinct levels, (1) things we understand and (2) things we don't understand. I find a gradation more than a break. And that is as far as I want to go. The \u201chigher things\u201d that we value but find hard to pin down are part of a continuum. At the simpler end of the continuum, link-joy is part of what we value; thinking about link-joy helps us to understand what is going on. I surmise that if people keep link-joy in mind, it will help as they move their thoughts up the continuum. People who try to think deeply about poetry and music, friendship and truth, a human life and a great work of art --- offer these people the concept of link-joy as a help toward crystallizing their thoughts.","title":"Chapter 5 Speculations"},{"location":"Chapter_5_Speculations/#chapter-5-speculations","text":"What makes humans so special? A link to religion Consciousness Ideals and \u201chigher things\u201d My program here has been to start from what is incontrovertible and move only cautiously to what is more doubtful. People do jigsaw puzzles; People enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles; What they enjoy mostly is the good fit of one piece with the next. People recite rhymes; People enjoy reciting rhymes; What they enjoy mostly is the rhyme of one word with the preceder. Joy from a jigsaw arises in my brain; There's an item in my brain that creates joy from a jigsaw. Joy from a rhyme arises in my brain; There's an item in my brain that creates joy from a rhyme. There is similarity between enjoying a jigsaw and enjoying a rhyme; Perhaps it is the same item that creates joy in both contexts. Perhaps I would manage my life better if I gave a little more attention to this effect; perhaps we would all manage our lives better if we jointly gave attention to this effect. But in this chapter, I abandon caution, strike out into the deep ocean, and offer some mere speculations. Like swimmers in the deep ocean, we lose touch with firm ground and may get swept to places that are not familiar. But at least I can name some topics --- see the chapter contents above. Let me reiterate that I claim no special authority and the whole chapter may have no practical value. The reader perhaps shares my inquisitiveness; if so, let's get on with it. But the uncertainties in this chapter should not obscure what seem like certainties in the chapters before.","title":"Chapter 5 Speculations"},{"location":"Chapter_5_Speculations/#what-makes-humans-so-special","text":"As already mentioned, the answer may be our relation to the supernatural, to a god or God or goddesses. On this point I have a belief or faith but I don't want to expound it, beyond saying that I think the earth is billions of years old and that, whoever is in charge, most attributes of people today evolved from a common ancestor that we share with chimpanzees. But beside the possibility of a divine spark, there are visible differences --- a vast range of differences between present day people and chimpanzees. According to the theory of evolution, if we trace these differences backward in time they eventually taper to nothing. And then if we begin to creep forward again, there is a moment when some difference or differences existed but were tiny; yet despite being tiny, they contained the seeds of all the differences we see now. One wonders about that crucial moment what the tiny difference or differences were. Obviously I don't know the answer. Many people have offered possibilities and each suggestion has some merit. My intention here is to add the suggestion that link-joy may have been a factor, and to suggest that as a factor it could perhaps have been large. First, let's avoid being over-simple. It seems that the human chimpanzee split occurred around 7 million years ago but we should not imagine, from that point on, just two populations or lines of descent, one leading to present-day chimpanzees and the other to humans. On either side there may well have been several branches. Indeed the chimpanzee side split into bonobos (\"pigmy chimpanzees\u201d) and the regular kind, and may have included other varieties as well, now extinct. On the human side, the majority opinion is that all present-day humans are descended from a group that existed in Africa less than 200 million years ago; all other variants that existed at that time on other continents are now extinct. In short, either side of the tree of descent was multi-branched. But the extra branches don't affect the basic question, Could link-joy have made a difference? Or perhaps it would be better to ask, How much difference could link-joy have made? We need to peer into a chimpanzee's mind: how much forward planning do they do? After reading lane Goodall's reports, I think it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that before settling in for the night, a chimpanzee has some ideas about the next day. She may remember the tree from which she got fruit today; she may imagine returning to that same tree again tomorrow (a fairly definite image), but I think she might instead carry in her mind the less specific idea \u201csome other fruit tree.\" She might imagine heading in a fresh direction tomorrow to an area where she thinks \u201csome other fruit tree\u201d is likely to be found. Of course all this thinking is done without words but a chimpanzee that has seen many trees can extract from that experience a general idea \"tree\" and the more specific idea \"fruit tree.\u201d Now she does this by grouping her memories of fruit trees in one group, nut trees in another group, and so on. The manner in which chimpanzees do their foraging indicates this much about their minds. But chimpanzees are pretty much down-to-earth; there is nothing high-falutin' about a chimpanzee. They form abstract concepts like \"some fruit tree\u201d (imagined in vague form, not specific) but only as far as material affairs are concerned. Where people might give much of their time to eating, shopping, sexual affairs and sport, with a chimpanzee you can leave out the shopping and sport. (On the other hand, to give them credit, some devote much time and care to raising their young; some are tender-hearted parents.) My point is that they don't speculate, they don't have flights of fancy, they don't juggle ideas for fun --- and that is exactly what people do. A person's mind is continually spinning ideas; even while we sleep, the ideas fly about and pop up in unusual combinations. But now I am looking at present-day people; what about early people, when they were much closer to chimpanzees? Here is what may have been crucial: once a person gets joy from matching two ideas together, there doesn't have to be any material gain. Once people get joy from matching, they are apt to sit around combining ideas just for the fun. For an example, think of one of our ancestors who sees a cloud above a mountain, a tree-branch above the ground, and her knee above her foot. With link-joy, she may think, \"That's neat, three examples of the same thing!\" --- and remember them, and later add a fourth. Without link-joy, the ancestor would know perfectly well what to do about fruit that was above her, but would never make the cloud-above-mountain connection. [A historical detail: in old-fashioned language, one might say that the ancestor I just described extracted the general character \u201cabove\u201d from the three instances. To \u201cextract a character\u201d would nowadays more often be called extracting a characteristic. But William James in 1892, more than a century ago, wrote \u201c... (animals) never extract characters for the mere fun of the thing, as men do.\" He put his finger on the very same difference that I am emphasizing now. But James did not see it as a possible cause of man's uniqueness, a cause of the divergence from chimpanzees --- probably because he was not looking for such a cause. And people who have looked for a cause since perhaps have not noticed James' perception.] There is a particular difficulty about the origin or development of human language. I distinguish here between language in animals (which covers material concerns --- eating, mating etc. --- and is limited) and language in humans (which by now covers an unimaginable variety and must from early on have had a tendency to sprout copiously). What language sprouts into so abundantly is words, ideas or concepts that are not of immediate material use. For sure, such words become useful later; once conversation gets started, a rich language facilitates all kinds of benefits. But what is the benefit at an earlier stage? To invent language about something of no immediate use, one has to form an idea (\u201chave something to say\u201d), then invent a word, and then find another person who might have formed the same idea and be ready to grasp the meaning of your word when you say it. As is often true today, an invention has to happen first and then its usefulness can be discovered later. So why would an early human form a useless idea and try to mention it to a companion? It is a formidable difficulty. But if forming an idea --- like the idea \"above\" in the example just discussed --- was a pleasure in itself, the difficulty is overcome; the pleasure is the motivation.","title":"What Makes Humans so Special?"},{"location":"Chapter_5_Speculations/#a-link-to-religion","text":"Some people believe that all religions are groundless. For such people, a puzzling question is, Where have religions come from? If there are not any supernatural entities, why do so many people believe that there are? Once a religion is well founded, many people believe it because their parents believed it, belief being inculcated while the person is young. But the question remains how a religion gets started in the first place. Partial answers have been offered on the following lines: 1 While a person is young and in the care of its parents, the idea that \"someone will take care of me\" is apt to take root. After the parents die, the idea remains attractive and a person may unconsciously invent a parent-substitute. 2 People from time to time have hallucinations. Some plants cause unusual states of mind, and some people can produce trances by sitting still etc. In some of these states, a person is seized by a conviction such as that everything exists because of a benevolent unifying influence. And such a conviction may persist or be remembered after the person returns to \u201cnormal.\u201d 3 Some natural events seem larger than human. Suppose an infant is chided by someone in a gruff voice and then hears thunder. It would not be surprising it the infant imagined that there is an even larger person with an even gruffer voice. Or suppose that in a community there is some conspicuously splendid, healthy, powerful, vigorous man or woman, and yet that person suddenly dies. The idea of their being struck by someone even more powerful but invisible might appear a possibility. The last of these is plausible cause for fear of a god, but what might prompt belief in a god or gods of benevolent type? Items 1 and 2 are possibilities, but I want to enlarge on item 3: can the natural world make us believe in benevolent gods as well as fearsome ones? I would not raise the question if I had no answer for it. The whole discussion is begun so that I can make a suggestion: a person is apt to be seized occasionally by the idea, \u201cIt's good to be alive!\" One's muscles seem to be working, one recently tasted something good, one has an occupation at which one expects to succeed and there are drifting clouds in a blue sky. Everything is as it should be, to such a marked extent that one thinks, \u201cSomeone must have organized this!\" Now \u201ceverything as it should be\u201d is a matching condition; the state matches an idea within oneself. Years of life provide an internal sense of how things should be and sometimes when one looks around, that's how they are. For example, when one admires an extensive view one's sense is, \u201cThat's as it should be. There is an enormous extent of stuff in view and it is all as it should be.\u201d One's pleasure from the matching is considerable and the idea that a benevolent god set it up comes rather readily to mind. Of course the majority of people believe that a benevolent god or God did set it up. In this section, I am just sketching a possibility in case it is of interest to the minority.","title":"A Link to Religion"},{"location":"Chapter_5_Speculations/#consciousness","text":"A fashionable topic! Consciousness is fashionable and link-joy unfashionable. Consciousness is something we share with chimpanzees while link-joy probably is not --- link-joy may be what makes humans unique. Surely what makes us different from chimpanzees is more interesting than what we share with them, yet consciousness is fashionable! There is no accounting for fashion. (Well, perhaps there is, but that is not our business here.) Some readers will already have objected, \" Human consciousness is different, human consciousness is something we do not share with chimpanzees.\u201d A person thinking on these lines may be thinking of self-consciousness, a person's awareness of his or her unique self. It is commonly supposed --- as far as I know correctly --- that a person's thoughts or feelings about his or her self, her personality, uniqueness, place in the universe etc. are more extensive than those of a chimpanzee; perhaps self -consciousness is what we should discuss. Now suppose someone suggests that what makes humans unique is this self-consciousness --- \"we have it, all other animals don't.\" I suggested earlier in this chapter that, instead, perhaps it is link-joy that makes humans unique, so how do these two suggestions fit together or clash? My thought is that self-awareness depends on link-joy. Self-awareness is just one among a group of things that only humans possess, but the whole group depends on link-joy and link-joy is the basic difference. The reason has to do with abstract concepts and levels of abstraction. I already looked at a chinipanzee's limited range of material concerns, and suggested that lini-ay will make a primate cogitate further. Simply for fun, to gain link-joy, a primate might for example gather instances of \"above.\" And, watching a river, she might conceive \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201crough\"; hearing a cushing river and the wind, she might \u201cnoisy.\u201d I am looking for concepts that don't help directly with finding food or avoiding harm, but might seem interesting. A primate who watches a smooth patch on a river might indicare it to a companion and (probably after a few false starts), they might agree on a sound to associate with it. Thus would begin the joy of conversation, and soon the material benefits of conversation and improved cooperation would reinforce the developments. But aside from material benefits, one level of abstraction leads to another: after \u201cnoisy\u201d and \u201cquiet\" comes the idea of loudness --- a thing that can be great or small. The difference between \u201csimple\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d is somewhat abstract, and a primate's ideas about time can obviously get more sophisticated by degrees. Finally, as part of this general process of building up more abstract ideas about the world, the primate builds more sophisticated ideas about herself; self-awareness develops along with growth-of-trees awareness, meteorology-awareness and ecological-balance awareness. Their own selves is just part of the package of things that humans understand and other animals do not, but the entire package depends on link-joy --- that's my suggestion.","title":"Consciousness"},{"location":"Chapter_5_Speculations/#ideals-and-higher-things","text":"If you were in the Louvre and saw someone approaching the Mona Lisa with a meat axe, would you hurl yourself in her way, even at great risk to yourself? If indeed the worst happened and you lay on the floor progressing toward death, but the felon was caught and the picture saved, would you think, \u201cI am glad. That picture is worth the sacrifice I have made\u201d? I hope no reader is faced with this situation. I imagine it just as an example of what I mean by \u201chigher things.\u201d The value of a great work of art is elusive --- many people feel that its value is in some way great, but in what way and how great are not so easy. An example closer to home involves truth and friendship. Should one lie to save a friend or allow harm to a friend for the sake of upholding truth? How much value does truth or friendship have? I am not going to try to answer these questions. My aim is simply to bring this kind of question into view. I want to establish the fact that there are values that everyone finds hard to pin down. One may be devoutly religious or quite the opposite; for all kinds of person, truth is apt to conflict with friendship from time to time. I emphasize the uncertainty just so that I can go a step farther: can attention to link-joy shed light on this difficult zone? Obviously I think link-joy can help --- I would not be writing this paragraph else. I don't think it can help much, but perhaps a little, enough for the line of thought to be worth pursuing. And the line of thought is: let us progress from the simple toward the more complex, from what's definite toward what is more nebulous. Here is an oversimplified picture: both poetry and music can be enjoyed at three levels. In poetry the simplest pleasures are those of rhyme and meter: Fear no more the heat o' the sun, Nor the furious winter's rages; Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta\u2019en thy wages. \u201cWages\" matches \u201crages,\" \"done\u201d matches \u201csun\u201d --- and tum ti-tum, ti-tum, ti-tum, the last four beats give us pleasure by matching the four before. Then a second level is that of metaphor, simile, allusion and so on. Does winter get in a furious rage? Certainly, on some blizzard nights I have felt that winter was actively malevolent, attacking me in person; I enjoy the match with the poet's thought there. But there is a third level, concerned with fortitude, acceptance and hope: if I enjoy the poem at this third level, is it because of some match with what I already feel, or do I enjoy Shakespeare's showing me a new possibility, as if opening a door? When I enjoy the poem as a whole, it is not so easy to say exactly what it is that I enjoy. With music similarly, the simplest pleasure is the rhythm. Then at the second level there are melodies, themes, variations and so on. We expect, we recognize, we enjoy various matchings among the sections of a song or an instrumental piece, and at this level I might hope to explain to someone else what it is that I enjoy. But again there is a third level, the impact of the song or sonata as a whole, that is much more difficult to express in words: what did the composer intend, what was the effect on my mood, does it matter if these two diverge, for what purpose does one listen and the other compose? Well, that picture is certainly oversimplified. In particular, the idea of three distinct and separable levels is hard to maintain. But the idea of a progression from simple toward complex and from definite toward indefinite seems robust. And the progression is gradual; I think it would be just as hard to maintain that there is a break, with two distinct levels, (1) things we understand and (2) things we don't understand. I find a gradation more than a break. And that is as far as I want to go. The \u201chigher things\u201d that we value but find hard to pin down are part of a continuum. At the simpler end of the continuum, link-joy is part of what we value; thinking about link-joy helps us to understand what is going on. I surmise that if people keep link-joy in mind, it will help as they move their thoughts up the continuum. People who try to think deeply about poetry and music, friendship and truth, a human life and a great work of art --- offer these people the concept of link-joy as a help toward crystallizing their thoughts.","title":"Ideals and \u201cHigher Things\""},{"location":"Chapter_6_Final_chapter_---_the_take-home_message/","text":"Chapter 6 Final chapter --- the take-home message We are close to the end and what do I expect to be remembered from all this? Let's return to the question that opened Chapter 1: \u201cI am not a psychologist or philosopher so why does this matter TO ME?\u201d From what has gone before, let me pick out a few pieces and offer an answer in four parts. First, the raindrop analogy. Anyone will agree that rainstorms matter: sometimes they cause destructive floods but more often they foster growth (and when rain follows a dry spell, the smell of freshness is one of nature's treats). But what is a rainstorm? It is an accumulation of droplets. Does a rain droplet matter to me? NO, it doesn't --- but an accumulation of uncountable droplets freshens my life. Most single link-joy events are non-essential; we could survive missing any one. But a day when we do not feel their cumulative effect is a dreary day indeed. Anyone who thinks that tiny link-joys are not important should compare them with raindrops. Second, the shouting-murmuring analogy. How quiet can a sound be and still be detectable? A few quiet sounds are: leaves rustling, one sock or stocking rubbing against another, or the noise from shaking a handkerchief. Two people talking make much more noise and yet are nowhere near the loudest sound one can tolerate. The range of sounds is enormous and goes downward to tiny levels, yet the entire range is handled by a single sensory system. We can imagine then that with link-joy as well, the range from conspicuous down to imperceptible is all handled by a single brain-system. The third part concerns novelty and the idea that novelty is a bigger influence than matching or sameness. Being bored is common, and bored people welcome any diversion; the relief is a pleasure, often large enough to be noticed. If I look back over a day, the moments I recall may be mostly moments when something fresh happened. All this is true, and pleasure from moments when \u201csomething happened\u201d is real and important. My point is that as well, pleasure from moments of link-joy is important too. Many link-joy moments are less noticeable than moments when something new happens, but they are more fundamental. Psychologists should not stop studying novelty but they should start studying link-joy as well. And ordinary people should go on seeking new tunes, new books, new friends. But don't forget to allow for the vast amounts of quiet pleasure we get from old tunes, books and friends. They are the firm foundation that allows us to leap into what's new. The last point concerns the daily news, which is mostly bad. News is delivered by newscasters of one kind or another; they make money by attracting customers and selling what customers will buy. Because link-joy is so common it is not news --- grief, harm and disasters bring in more money. Every year the means of distributing more news to more people become more powerful, and so news about unhappiness is a swelling flood --- and a distorting flood: the world is a far happier place than you would guess from the supply of news. Now, to some extent people shape the cities and communities they live in and, if this is so, we need people to see things as they are and not in some distorted form. That is, we need to counter the trend by remembering the distortion. We need to remember omnipresent link-joy (among other daily pleasures) when we try to guide our communities into the future. I speculated in Chapter 5 that perhaps link-joy played a role in where people come from. Now I am suggesting, more definitely, that it needs to be recognized whenever we look at where we are headed. People in general are not killers. Our struggles against poverty, drugs etc. are not war. For most people, tomorrow's experiences will not include violence. Given the option of dying tonight, people prefer to wake to see tomorrow and that is because tomorrow is good --- it will be full of link-joy. To plan for tomorrow, we need to see tomorrow it is likely to be.

It may begin with a taste on your tongue or a sound in your ear, but it is inside your brain that the pleasure is sensed. To check this, suppose you are asleep when I put a drop of sweet fruit juice on your tongue. Unless the action wakes you, you feel no pleasure --- to sense pleasure you need a conscious brain. And the pleasure-sensor can be set off by two things matching. An example is rhyme: \u201cThe cat in a hat\u201d is a livelier title than \u201cThe cat on a rug.\" And a pair of shoes that match give an effect that we don't get from two odd shoes --- an effect that, though small, is real. The main idea is that this pleasure from matching pervades our lives. The air we breathe is little-noticed but essential, and pleasure from matching is the same. We get it in such a constant stream that it goes unnoticed, but everything we do that is different from chimpanzees has pleasure from matching as a part. Of all the differences that make us human, getting pleasure from matching may be the most essential; we would not be human without it and it shapes each life from birth to death, from beginning to end. \u201cNonsense!\" you say. \u201cI get pleasure from going to a party, watching a ball-game, swimming ...\" Of course! To enjoy yourself is to be animated, jolly, with zest; it isn't brainwork. My point is that even without doing brainwork, still the pleasure you get comes from your brain, not from your eyes or your fingers. Your brain is constantly delivering pleasure and to know something about the process might be a benefits Immediately, questions arise: * If things that match are so important, why hasn't someone said so before? * Who is this writer, some kind of oddball? Must I take him seriously? But first, is this pleasure from matching all that important? Rhymes and shoes are fairly small concerns. Before going farther, let's look at something more consequential -- conversation. a: \u201cYou remember Chris from last Friday?\" b: \"Yes, in that eye-catching shirt.\u201d a: \"Almost a technicolor dreamcoat, wasn't it?\" b:\u201cYes, I almost called him Joseph ...\" or else: a: \"You remember Chris from last Friday?\" b: \u201cThe fellow who played the piano?\u201d a: \u201cNo, the person in the fancy shirt.\u201d b: \u201cFancy shirt? I don't remember any ...\" The first two talkers are on the same wavelength, enjoying rapport. Both know the old title Joseph and his amazing technicolor dreamcoat and whenever one made an allusion, the other picked it up. By contrast, the second conversation was going nowhere; the second pair would soon drift apart dissatisfied. Now this difference runs deep. Think of your friends. Who is a real friend? Someone who, when you say something, knows what you are talking about. With a friend, conversation is a pleasure. And the reason is that when Pat or Chris makes a remark, you can find in your own mind a meaning that matches their words. Another part of conversation is your own remarks, finding the right phrase. When you can't find suitable words it is frustrating and disappointing, but when you succeed you feel pleasure. Now this is different from shoes and rhymes --- speech for a community is like electricity for a town; speech is the power-current throughout human life. If it is true that speaking and hearing run on pleasure from matching, that pleasure indeed lies deep. It is the warp and weft of the fabric of our lives, or of our mental lives at least. Let us then return to the questions, \"If it is so important, why haven't we heard about it before?\" And, \"Is this writer off his head or on the level?\" Short answers are (1) it has been almost pointed out before, and (2) I in person am as ignorant and muddleheaded as anyone. But when I focus on this particular idea, it is hard to find any weakness in it: We do converse We do enjoy conversation The pleasure does come partly from matching The matching is done in our brains Our brains generate pleasure from other kinds of matching too (in music, sport, science and art as well as rhymes and shoes). Indeed, the pleasure is like the drops of rain in a rainstorm: each individual drop is tiny but they are so numerous, they drench the world. The pleasure from infinitely numerous tiny matchings adds up to one of the great influences in our lives. To cover the first question I will look briefly at some previous writers, the antecedents. To cover the second, I will put a simple list of 35 points at which the effect enters our lives. No one needs to read all of these --- different people have different interests. One need only look at enough of these to be satisfied that the effect is indeed pervasive. Then, assuming the reader wishes to go further, I will return to the table of contents for what follows. Let's not forget that pleasure is the topic. I have found gathering these notions endlessly beguiling, and I hope to arrange them so that the reader too enjoys the journey. To this end, I have interspersed jokes, quotations and boxes with anecdotes, but the busy reader can ignore these; the essentials are in the main text.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Introduction/#introduction","text":"Let me begin by telling the main idea: Pleasure arises in your brain.

Before going farther, let's look at something more consequential -- conversation. a: \u201cYou remember Chris from last Friday?\" b: \"Yes, in that eye-catching shirt.\u201d a: \"Almost a technicolor dreamcoat, wasn't it?\" b:\u201cYes, I almost called him Joseph ...\" or else: a: \"You remember Chris from last Friday?\" b: \u201cThe fellow who played the piano?\u201d a: \u201cNo, the person in the fancy shirt.\u201d b: \u201cFancy shirt? I don't remember any ...\" The first two talkers are on the same wavelength, enjoying rapport. Both know the old title Joseph and his amazing technicolor dreamcoat and whenever one made an allusion, the other picked it up. By contrast, the second conversation was going nowhere; the second pair would soon drift apart dissatisfied. Now this difference runs deep. Think of your friends. Who is a real friend? Someone who, when you say something, knows what you are talking about. With a friend, conversation is a pleasure. And the reason is that when Pat or Chris makes a remark, you can find in your own mind a meaning that matches their words. Another part of conversation is your own remarks, finding the right phrase. When you can't find suitable words it is frustrating and disappointing, but when you succeed you feel pleasure. Now this is different from shoes and rhymes --- speech for a community is like electricity for a town; speech is the power-current throughout human life. If it is true that speaking and hearing run on pleasure from matching, that pleasure indeed lies deep. It is the warp and weft of the fabric of our lives, or of our mental lives at least. Let us then return to the questions, \"If it is so important, why haven't we heard about it before?\" And, \"Is this writer off his head or on the level?\" Short answers are (1) it has been almost pointed out before, and (2) I in person am as ignorant and muddleheaded as anyone. But when I focus on this particular idea, it is hard to find any weakness in it: We do converse We do enjoy conversation The pleasure does come partly from matching The matching is done in our brains Our brains generate pleasure from other kinds of matching too (in music, sport, science and art as well as rhymes and shoes). Indeed, the pleasure is like the drops of rain in a rainstorm: each individual drop is tiny but they are so numerous, they drench the world. The pleasure from infinitely numerous tiny matchings adds up to one of the great influences in our lives. To cover the first question I will look briefly at some previous writers, the antecedents. To cover the second, I will put a simple list of 35 points at which the effect enters our lives. No one needs to read all of these --- different people have different interests. One need only look at enough of these to be satisfied that the effect is indeed pervasive. Then, assuming the reader wishes to go further, I will return to the table of contents for what follows. Let's not forget that pleasure is the topic. I have found gathering these notions endlessly beguiling, and I hope to arrange them so that the reader too enjoys the journey. To this end, I have interspersed jokes, quotations and boxes with anecdotes, but the busy reader can ignore these; the essentials are in the main text.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Personal_history/","text":"Personal history I used to be a teacher. It was being a teacher that started me in the brain business. I was not an outstanding teacher --- not the worst but certainly not the best. In many college classrooms people sleep at the back but in my classes people would sleep at the front. There was Frank with whom I am still friends: he would arrive on time and sit in the front row, even in the middle of the front row, and in ten minutes he would nod off. The topic was geology, classes were small and it was all quite friendly but one could not avoid thinking, \u201cWhy is he here? Why am I here? What exactly are we trying to accomplish by getting together for 50 minutes three times a week?\u201d One of my answers was that a mind is like a tool-box with a variety of tools. The difference between the skilled and the unskilled is: a skilled person can use each tool, knows what task each is good for, and knows how to keep them sharp --- she doesn't use a chisel as a screwdriver. One of my thoughts was, \u201cI'll help these people to understand their mental tool-kits. They must decide what to attempt in their lives but I will help them set about it in a workmanlike way.\" But there was more: I thought, \u201cThese people will never use their skills in later life if they don't enjoy the process. What is there in these classes that they enjoy?\" Some of the time certainly was enjoyable, studying schist and gneiss and things that were blastopsephitic. Some of the things we looked at were so richly textured that a friend made money from them as wallpaper designs. But the best part was imitations. In geology --- in a cliff or a road-cut, say --- we see the result of a process and the question is, How did it happen? We would get putty, Play-doh and other squashable materials, maltreat them and see the effect --- and sometimes it was just as we saw in the rocks. Well, not just like, but with some points of resemblance. That was what the people enjoyed --- \u201cHey, neat-oh! Look at that!\u201d The form of words changes from decade to decade but the link-joy moment is the same. It works in reverse too. Another approach is to imagine a material with such and such properties, imagine some forces, and figure by mathematics what effects would ensue. Suppose in the theory, the top part always breaks in a particular way: then you scurry out to the rocks and see if you can find any sign of the same thing there. Beside intentions, there is also luck. The preceding situation had arisen --- I had strung together some beautiful equations to say that if the rocks began as even, uniform, regular layers then it should be possible to find such-and-such results; the small kinks should be related to the larger kinks in a special way. But where to find rocks of such an ideal kind? There were some famous rocks in Japan and some in Nova Scotia; I hunted in Arkansas and in Pennsylvania. But when I traveled with my new wife on some family visits, there was what I needed at the bottom of my Auntie Tim's garden. Sometimes we look for them, sometimes we stumble upon them by accident. Either way, match-ups are the lynch-pins of our lives. Before I was a teacher I spent a year in the Antarctic and for part of the time we traveled around, living in tents. An advantage of living in a tent is that one can make breakfast while still in bed. The inside walls of the tent were apt to be crusted with hoar-frost so, by custom, we put the stove in a central location where it could be reached with one's elbows hardly out of the sleeping bag. But one morning the stove was giving trouble and in the dim light I could not see why; what was wrong with the silly thing? I reached for a candle, but not even the candle would light properly: just a tiny blue halo of flame sat on the tip of the wick. Almost six feet of snow had fallen in the night, the tent was nearly covered, and our oxygen supply was quite far gone. It is lucky we woke or we might not have woken. The point of this episode is to emphasize that the weather was often too bad for traveling. We might be stuck for days on end with little to do but read, and I was able to creep like a bookworm through many pages by Bertrand Russell. He was good with terse writing bu the only point at which I remember his exact words is where he notes that, if one shuts one eye, one's nose appears \"vast and portentous.\" I want to comment on this deception.

For example: Thomas Aquinas in AD 1274 wrote that a creative artist in beginning a work has some idea of what he intends to create, and the artist derives pleasure if eventually the result matches that idea. Johann Goethe in 1771 wrote that when viewing art, one gets pleasure only if there is already in oneself a seed that the artwork matches. and William James in 1892 wrote that, among mammals, only humans note the resemblances among similar objects solely for pleasure (whereas other animals may do so if a material benefit is involved). These bits of history are only disjointed scraps, but Arthur Koestler in 1964 realized the sameness of these and other instances: In a joke, the punch-line matches the preamble In a Eureka moment, two ideas in a person's mind come together with a good match or good fit In a poem, the poet hits on a metaphor that neatly captures the idea she wants to convey, and so on. To draw attention to the common feature --- two items fitting or matching --- that is present throughout this great variety of contexts, he invented the term \u201cbisociation.\u201d But as far as I know, Koestler did not comment on the third element, the momentary pleasure at the moment of match-up. The pleasure accompanying a match appears in 1973 in an essay \u201cThe Illusion of Beauty.\u201d Koestler's book fills 751 pages whereas N Humphrey's essay occupies only 11. But Humphrey emphasizes matching, spans as wide a range of contexts as Koestler, and includes the pleasure aspect. He likens rhymes to a stamp-collection: both yield their pleasure through having elements that match, and so does a Gothic church or a musical symphony. The present book extends some aspects, such as brain physiology, that Humphrey does not touch but the essential core is all present in Humphrey's short essay. Brain physiology is added to the recipe by John McCrone in 1993. His book is a broad survey of the human mind but it includes two pithy phrases: \"... this natural ability of the brain --- to make insightful matches and flood the brain with pleasurable feelings ...\" and \"... the physiological click that follows the matching of a sensation with a memory.\u201d McCrone goes beyond Humphrey when he refers to the matching as a physiological event. And his conclusion is expressed with more force: \u201cPsychology is in desperate need of reform\" for lack of attention to this effect. Finally in 1999 a professional neuroscientist comes on the scene: Joshua Fost. \u201cWe are all familiar with the satisfaction of remembering a location, fixing a broken device, or generally just being right. Can we explain why, neurobiologically, our brains cause us to ... feel this way?\" He pinpoints satisfaction , names a range of contexts , and sees that there must be a mechanism in our brains that links matching to pleasure . As far as I know, Fost is the first neuroscientist to try to conceive how that link might operate, in terms of neurons and the chemicals that work with them. (Soon after publishing his epoch-making paper, Fost quit neuroscience and, as far as I know, no professional has stepped in to continue his quest. It appears that we have on hand a problem absolutely central to understanding human culture that is within the scope of modern neuroscience methods, and that no neuroscientist is giving it any attention.

Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. An imaginative conception of what might be true is the starting point of all great discoveries in science. The authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual. Joy remains the most poorly studied human emotion. Under every possible disadvantage of ignorance, inexperience and lack of proper materials, I started not from zero but from frozen depths of ignorance which no thermometer records. There are many ways in which the thing I am trying in vain to say may be tried in vain to be said. The ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. Push on, and faith will catch up with you.
